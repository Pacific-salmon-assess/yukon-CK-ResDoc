# Data sources  

## üìÅ`raw` includes raw data and data generated in models needed to create this analysis.  

## üìÅ`generated` data are files generated from the analyses in this repository.

| üìÅ`simulations` | folder containing files `H_fwd_x.csv` and `S_fwd_x.csv` which describe projections of catch (i.e., harvest) and spawners through time under different HCRs.

    Productivity scenarios:
        - TVA: Recent generational average of _alpha_ estimates from time-varying alpha (TVA) models ('reference scenario')
        - TVA2: Most recent year _alpha_ estimate from time-varying alpha (TVA) models ('worst case scenario')
        - TVA3: Long-term average of _alpha_ estimates from time-varying alpha (TVA) models ('best case scenario')
        - AR1: _alpha_ estimate from stationary, autoregressive (AR1) models (not used)
