# RUN_RECONSTRUCTION MODEL {#app:first-appendix}

- general description of multi-population run-reconstruction model

## POPULATION DYNAMICS 

## OBSERVATION MODEL 

## MODEL FITTING AND DIAGNOSTICS 

\clearpage


# SPAWNER_RECRUITMENT MODELS  {#app:second-appendix}

- general description of multi-population state-space approach and why we chose it
- acknowledge that approach is expected to yield less biased estimates of key population characteristic than traditional spawner-recruitment models that can arise due to errors-in-variables and time-series bias


## PROCESS MODEL 

- equations and descriptions 

## OBSERVATION MODEL 

- equations and descriptions 

## MODEL FITTING AND DIAGNOSTICS 
- description [table: parameters and associated prior and posterior distributions]
- brief description of why we think fit was adequate (e.g., R-hat, ESS, trace plots and posterior predictive checks) along with any parameters that were hard to estimate [HTML Supplement: prior/posterior predictive checks, traceplots, ESS, R-hat]
- description of spawner-recruitment relationships [figure: spawner-recruitment relationships by CU]

## BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE POINTS 
- equations for each benchmark (Sgen, Smsy, Umsy, Smsr)
- equations and approach for estimating benchmarks from demographic SR models

This document aims to be transparent and reproducible. 
All data and code to reproduce the analysis in the report, and generate it, is available in [this Zenodo hosted](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13328248) [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/FR-PK-ResDoc/tree/v1.0?tab=readme-ov-file)  
The document describing model diagnostics and some additional figures can be found within the repository at `Supplement-model-check.html`. 


To reproduce this report, clone the repository from GitHub, make sure you have the required software installed, run `fit-sr-stan.R` to fit the models, then `index.Rmd` to create the document. 

Look at documentation on the `README` on the main page of the repository for more details.  

R packages (and dependencies therein) necessary to recreate this analysis are: 
```{r env}
suppressWarnings({suppressMessages({
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(rosettafish)
library(csasdown)
library(kableExtra)
library(rstan)
library(gsl)
library(cowplot)
library(scales)
})})
pkgs <- sort(c("here", "tidyverse", "rosettafish", "csasdown", "kableExtra", "rstan", "gsl", "cowplot", "scales"))

pkg_table <- devtools::session_info()$packages %>%
  dplyr::filter(package %in% pkgs) %>%
  dplyr::select(package, loadedversion, date) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Package = package, Version = loadedversion, Date = date) 

rownames(pkg_table) <- NULL
csasdown::csas_table(pkg_table)
```
