# ANTHROPOGENIC, ECOSYSTEM, AND CLIMATE FACTORS AFFECTING THE STOCK {#sec:factors}

The past decade has seen a considerable amount of research into anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors that may have contributed to the recent and long-term declines in body size and productivity of Yukon Chinook salmon. These factors are hypothesized to act across the multiple life stages and ecosystems utilized by Yukon Chinook salmon (Table \@ref(tab:tab-factors-summary)). The sections below summarize what is currently known about factors affecting the stock by life stage, but is not an exhaustive review. There are additional considerations in the habitat section \@ref(#sec:HABITAT), which may pertain to multiple life stages and may also be due to anthropogenic factors.

## Spawning Adults

The adult freshwater return migration of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon is one of the longest of any Pacific salmon populations, up to 3,200km [@brown2017], and spawning is believed to be the life stage where both environmental and intrinsic factors (e.g., age and/or size) are most limiting the productivity of Yukon Chinook salmon and present the highest risk to the future of the stock [@howard2023]\footnote{von Finster, A., Murdoch, A., Gill, J., Hawkins, T., Hodgson, J., and Knight, K. In prep. Issues Facing Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook Salmon.\label{vonfinsteretal}}. Over their long freshwater migrations, Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon can be exposed to a range of temperature and flow conditions, especially those that spawn in smaller tributaries. High maximum daily temperatures and maximum weekly temperatures are negatively associated with the productivity of some CUs (White, Stewart, and Pelly) [@feddern2024; @murdoch2024], and this is hypothesized to occur via reduced survival and spawning success with effects that carry over to juvenile production in the following generation [@vonbiela2020; @murdoch2024]. Heat stress occurs at 18$^\circ$C and intensifies at 21$^\circ$C for Yukon River Chinook salmon [@bowen2020; @usepa2003]. Adult Chinook salmon that experienced warmer water temperatures and lower discharge in the mainstem Yukon River during their return migrations tended to produce fewer juveniles per spawning adult [@howard2023]. The timing of upstream migrations differs among CUs (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-run-timing)), likely in part due to the thermal regimes in which eggs incubate [@connors2022], and they may be differently adapted to temperatures during their spawning migration. This adaptation along with cumulative exposure to high temperatures during migration may explain variation among CUs in their relationships with migration temperatures, for example, the productivity of mainstem CUs tend to be minimally associated with migration temperature, while the Pelly, Stewart, and White CUs tend to be the most strongly related [@feddern2024].

Pathogens and disease are also a concern in spawning adults, and their impact is likely mediated by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature during return migrations). *Ichthyophonus hoferi* is a pathogen that can infect immature or maturing Chinook salmon in the marine environment [@murphy2023; @murphy2024_youtube], but infection is most likely to impact survival and reproductive success during spawning migrations. It is believed to infect female Chinook salmon more than males [@kocan2004]. Signs of infection appear greatest near the midpoint of migration for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon [@liller-ich2023] and it has been hypothesized that *Ichthyophonus* could be responsible in part for border passage near Eagle, AK being lower in some years then estimated based upon passage and genetic estimates at Pilot Station, in the lower Yukon River\textsuperscript{1}. Another issue affecting spawners is thiamine deficiency, a condition related to diet in the marine environment that disproportionately affects salmon with long migrations [@larson2019]. Low thiamine levels in spawning adults and subsequently low stores in eggs may also be contributing to lower run sizes [@larson2019; @howard2023], but research on its impacts and causes in Yukon River Chinook salmon is limited. It is not clear how *Ichthyophonus* may differently affect fish originating from different parts of the Yukon River drainage, but it can be assumed that those with the longest migrations are the most susceptible to pre-spawn mortality as a result of *Ichthyophonus* infection (i.e., Teslin and Stewart CUs). 

In addition to these biotic and abiotic stressors, hydroelectric facilities at Mayo and Whitehorse Rapids pose localized challenges to adult migration. The Mayo facility built in the 1950s obstructs adult fish passage, locally extirpating Chinook Salmon from the upper reaches of the Mayo River and Mayo Lake, in the Pelly CU. Gravel starvation and channel works potentially contribute to reduced quality of spawning habitat below the dam as well\textsuperscript{1}. The Whitehorse Rapids facility (Upper Yukon CU) and storage dam have fish ladders for adult passage, but the efficacy of the ladder is low (31%), particularly for females [13%, @twardek2023adult].

## Egg, fry, and smolt

The survival of salmon during their egg incubation and freshwater rearing life stages is influenced by hydrology and broader climate conditions. There is some evidence that above average streamflows during egg incubation in the fall is negatively associated with Yukon Chinook salmon productivity [@feddern2024]. Warmer winter temperatures in freshwater during incubation and rearing are associated with above average Yukon Chinook salmon productivity [@murdoch2024]. However, it is considered unlikely that environmentally driven changes in egg survival are principally responsible for the declining productivity observed in Yukon Chinook salmon populations [@lamborn2025].

Climate and hydrological conditions during fry rearing are also associated with Yukon Chinook salmon productivity. High levels of precipitation during the fry stage are associated with lower productivity [@murdoch2024]. The date of Yukon River ice out (break-up of river ice in spring) is associated with smolt outmigration timing, and earlier ice out years have been linked with increased survival and Yukon Chinook salmon productivity [@murdoch2024; @cunningham2018]. In smaller tributaries, the formation of stream ice (aufeis) can reduce or even stop stream flow, which can be fatal to rearing salmon [@bradford2001]. Climate change is expected to result in earlier ice out, but it also increase winter temperature variability, potentially increasing the prevalence of irregular ice formations like aufeis. Observed impacts of climate change on rearing Yukon Chinook salmon appear to have complex causes, and future responses are uncertain. The arctic is warming more rapidly than more Southern latitudes [@rantanen2022], meaning that the freshwater habitats used by more Northern CUs (Porcupine, Old Crow, and Salmon Fork) are likely to experience the most change from the cumulative impacts of a changing climate, resulting permafrost thaw, and glacial retreat, which are discussed in @\ref:(sec:HABITAT).

The Whitehorse Rapids hydroelectric facility requires smolts from the Upper Yukon CU to pass downstream over the spillway, through the power generation turbines, or through the fish ladder. Recent studies indicate that downstream mortality rates could be as high as 30%, and could stun juveniles as they pass through the facility, increasing their vulnerability to predators downstream [@twardek2023juve]. It is possible that flow regimes and gravel starvation from the Mayo hydroelectric facility are impacting incubation and rearing below the dam, but the extent of impact is unclear\textsuperscript{1}.

Placer mining, nearly all (96%) of which occurs in the central Yukon [@vanloon2025], can have a large impact on stream beds, banks, and surrounding terrain. Sluicing, road development, and tailings ponds can increase fine sediment suspension, deposit sedmient downstream, and cause bank destabilization\textsuperscript{1}. Sedimentation can impact the incubation of salmon eggs by impeding oxygen absorption, thereby reducing the egg-to-fry survival rate [@jensen2009]. Elevated levels of sedimentation and turbidity can also can impact fry survival by reducing primary and secondary productivity of aquatic systems, and may also change the behaviour of fry [@dfo2000]. Current regulations for placer mining do not consider cumulative impacts of multiple mining locations throughout the watershed, and mining activities affect multiple CUs. The most gold production (47%) takes place in the Northern Yukon and White CUs near Dawson, with smaller operations near the lower Stewart River, Mayo, the South McQuesten River, Kluane, Whitehorse, Livingstone, and Dawson Range, or six of the twelve Yukon River Chinook salmon CUs (Northern, White, Pelly, Middle Yukon, Upper Yukon, and Teslin).

## Juvenile

The climatic and ecosystem conditions that salmon encounter in their first year in the marine environment can affect survival and growth during juvenile or maturing marine life stages. Similar to river ice, sea ice in the Bering Sea is related to the outmigration of Yukon Chinook salmon, and productivity is higher when sea ice melts early [@feddern2024; @bradford2008; @howard2017]. Decreasing ice cover in the estuary may also be associated with increased food resources available to juvenile salmon [@murphy2021]. Earlier outmigration and abundant food resources allow higher growth and survival in the first months of marine life, which are generally considered a critical life stage with relatively high mortality [@cunningham2018]. Warmer winter temperatures in the first year at sea are also associated with higher productivity for Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon, but there is less evidence of a relationship with summer temperatures [@feddern2024; @murdoch2024]. Future climate change will likely continue to reduce sea ice and increase winter temperatures, but it should not be assumed that this will result in positive outcomes for Yukon River chinook salmon. The rate of ocean warming in the Bering Sea is several times higher than elsewhere in the North Pacific, and historical relationships between salmon and ocean conditions can erode or even reverse under new conditions (@litzow2018, @litzow2020). Conditions during early marine life may already be detrimental in some years; for example, juvenile energy density decreased in 2019, the hottest recorded year in the Bering Sea [@murphy2023]. Increasing temperatures during this life stage have also been correlated with an increase in the number of returning jacks (salmon that return early), thereby contributing to overall declines in the average size of spawners [@murphy2021].

Subadult and adult Chinook salmon are vulnerable to predation by apex predators including salmon sharks and killer whales, including in the Eastern Bering Sea [@seitz2019]. There is some evidence that killer whale abundance is increasing in the North Pacific generally, possibly contributing to declines in both survival and size via size-selective predation on large Chinook salmon in coastal waters [@ohlberger2019]. However, there is no research indicating the role apex predators may play in the declining size and abundance of Yukon River Chinook salmon specifically.

## Adult

While data pertaining to the adult marine life stage are relatively scarce, the condition and size of Yukon River Chinook salmon upon entering freshwater is easily observed, which has led to hypotheses that prey quality and/or availability in the Bering Sea have declined in recent decades (SOURCE?). The availability of high quality prey for Chinook Salmon in the Bering Sea is mediated by bottom-up and top-down processes, both of which are likely affected by ocean warming and other climate shifts caused by climate change. Increasingly abundant pink salmon in the Bering Sea may be decreasing prey availability for Yukon River Chinook salmon [@feddern2024; @lamborn2025]. While pink and Chinook salmon typically occupy a different trophic niche [@johnson2009], pink salmon are highly efficient foragers that are capable of causing trophic cascades that affect many levels of marine food webs [@ruggerone2023; @ruggerone2016], meaning that competitive interactions may be indirect. It has also been hypothesized that ocean warming due to climate change has altered abundance and/or distributions of Yukon River Chinook salmon prey in the Eastern Bering Sea where they stage for spawning migration, potentially causing the thiamine deficiency that has been observed in migrating adults [@howard2023].

Suboptimal prey and increased competition for Chinook salmon combined with a projected shrinking of suitable ocean habitat [@abdul-aziz2011] are likely already contributing to poorer marine habitat conditions for adult Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon in their marine life stage. However, the high-seas habitat that Chinook salmon occupy as adults is governed by large-scale climate processes that are known to exhibit regime shift-like changes that have major implications for growth and survival of adult salmon [@litzow2018]
