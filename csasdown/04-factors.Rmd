# ANTHROPOGENIC, ECOSYSTEM AND CLIMATE FACTORS AFFECTING THE STOCK {#sec:factors}

The past decade has seen a considerable amount of research into anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors that may be contributing to recent and long-term declines in body size and productivity in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook. These factors act across multiple life stages and ecosystems utilized by Yukon Chinook salmon (Table \@ref(tab-factors-summary)). This section briefly summarizes what is currently known about factors affecting the stock by life stage, but is not an exhaustive review.

## Spawning Adults

The adult freshwater return migration of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon is one of the longest of any Pacific salmon populations, up to 3,200km [@brown2017] , and spawning is believed to be the life stage where both environmental factors and individual fish dynamics (e.g., age and/or size) are most limiting the productivity of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon and present the highest risk to the future of the stock [@howard2023; @vonfinster]. Over their long freshwater migrations, Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon can be exposed to a range of temperature and flow conditions, especially those fish who do not spawn in the mainstem. Maximum daily temperatures [@feddern2024] and maximum weekly temperatures above 18oC [@murdoch2024] are negatively associated with the productivity of some CUs, and this is hypothesized to occur via reduced survival and spawning success with carry over effects to juvenile production in the following generation [@vonbiela2020; @murdoch2024]. Heat stress occurs at 18oC and intensifies at 21oC for Yukon River Chinook salmon [@bowen2020; @u.s.epa2003], and in the Yukon, adult Chinook salmon that experienced warmer water temperatures and lower discharge in the mainstem Yukon River during their return migrations tended to produce fewer juveniles per spawning adult [@howard2023]. Conservation Units (CUs) vary in the timing of their upstream migrations, likely in part due to the thermal regimes in which their eggs incubate [@connors2022] and they may be differently adapted to temperatures during their spawning migration, which may explain variation among CUs in their relationships with migration temperature. For example, mainstem CUs tend to have the weakest relationships between productivity and migration temperatures, while the Pelly, Stewart, and White-Donjek CUs tend to have the strongest relationships [@feddern2024].

Pathogens and disease are also a concern in spawning adults, and their impact is likely mediated by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature during return migrations). *Ichthyophonus hoferi* is a pathogen that can infect immature or maturing Chinook salmon in the marine environment [@murphy2023; @murphy2024], but infection is most likely to impact survival and reproductive success during spawning migrations. It is believed to infect female Chinook salmon more than males [@kocan2004]. Signs of infection appear greatest near the midpoint of Canadian Yukon Chinook salmon migrations [@carroll2023] and it has been hypothesized that *Ichthyophonus* could be responsible in part for returns at the border crossing at Eagle being lower than forecasts based on counts near the river mouth [@vonfinster]. Another issue affecting spawners is thiamine deficiency, a condition related to diet in the marine environment that disproportionately affects salmon with long migrations [@larson2019]. Low thiamine levels in spawning adults and subsequently low stores in eggs may also be contributing to lower run sizes [@larson2019; @howard2023], but research on its impacts and causes in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon is limited.

There are local population effects related to hydroelectric facilities at Mayo and Whitehorse Rapids. The Mayo facility obstructs all passage of adult fish into historically productive habitat, which locally extirpated the population during construction in the 1950s. Gravel starvation and channel works potentially contribute to reduced quality of spawning habitat below the dam as well [@vonfinster]. The Whitehorse Rapids facility and storage dam have fish ladders for adult passage, but the efficacy of the ladder is low (31%), particularly for females (13%) [@twardek2023].

## Egg, fry, and smolt

The survival of salmon during their egg incubation and freshwater rearing life stages is influenced by hydrology and broader climate conditions. There is some evidence that above average streamflows during egg incubation in the fall is negatively associated with productivity [@feddern2024]. Warmer winter temperatures in freshwater during incubation and rearing are associated with above average productivity [@murdoch2024]. However, it is considered unlikely that environmentally driven changes in egg survival are principally responsible for observed productivity declines in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon populations [@vonfinster; @lamborn2025].

Climate and hydrological conditions during fry rearing are also associated with productivity. High levels of precipitation during the fry stage are associated with lower productivity [@murdoch2024]. The date of Yukon River ice out (break-up of river ice in spring) is associated with smolt outmigration timing, and earlier ice out years have been linked with increased survival and productivity [@murdoch2024; @cunningham2018]. In smaller tributaries, the formation of stream ice (aufeis) can reduce or even stop stream flow, which can be fatal to rearing salmon [@bradford2001]. Climate change is expected to result in earlier ice out, but it also increase winter temperature variability, potentially increasing the prevalence of irregular ice formations like aufeis. Observed impacts of climate change on rearing Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon appear to have complex causes, and future responses are uncertain.

The Whitehorse Rapids hydroelectric facility requires smolts to pass downstream over the spillway, through the power generation turbines, or through the fish ladder. Recent studies indicate that downstream mortality rates could be as high as 30%, and could stun juveniles as they pass through the facility, increasing their vulnerability to predators downstream ] [@twardek2023]. It is possible that flow regimes and gravel starvation from the Mayo hydroelectric facility are impacting incubation and rearing below the dam, but the extent of impact is unclear [@vonfinster].

In the central Yukon area, which comprises nearly all (96%) of Yukon Territory's placer mining production [@vanloon2025], placer mining activities can have a large impact on stream beds, banks, and surrounding terrain. Activities related to placer and gold mining, including sluicing, road development, and tailings ponds, can create downstream sediment deposition and increase fine sediment suspension, as well as increase bank destabilization [@vonfinster]. Sedimentation can impact egg incubation through reduced oxygen absorption, reduce the egg-to-fry survival rate [@jensen2009], and change the behaviour of fry [@dfo2000]. Elevated turbidity and sediment levels can reduce primary and secondary productivity of aquatic systems, further impacting fry survival [@dfo2000]. Additionally, current regulations for placer mining do not consider cumulative impacts of multiple mining locations throughout the watershed.

## Juvenile

The climatic and ecosystem conditions that salmon encounter in their first year in the marine environment can affect survival and growth during juvenile or maturing marine life stages. Similar to river ice, sea ice in the Bering Sea is related to the outmigration of Yukon Chinook, and productivity is higher when sea ice melts early [@feddern2024; @bradford2008; @howard2017]. Decreasing ice cover in the estuary may also be associated with increased food resources available to juvenile salmon [@murphy2021]. Earlier outmigration and abundant food resourcesÂ allow higher growth and survival in the first months of marine life, which are generally considered a critical life stage with relatively high mortality [@cunningham2018]. Warmer winter temperatures in the first year at sea are also associated with higher productivity, but there is less evidence of any such relationship with summer temperatures [@feddern2024; @murdoch2024]. Future climate shifts will likely continue to reduce sea ice and increase winter temperatures, but it should not necessarily be assumed that historical relationships will hold under future climate conditions to increase productivity. Conditions during early marine life may already be detrimental in some years; for example, juvenile energy density decreased in 2019, the hottest recorded year in the Bering Sea [@murphy2023]. Increasing temperatures during this life stage have also been correlated with an increase in the number of returning jacks (salmon that return early), thereby contributing to overall declines in the average size of spawners [@murphy2021].

Subadult Chinook salmon are vulnerable to predation by apex predators (salmon sharks and killer whales). There is some evidence that killer whale abundance is increasing in the North Pacific generally, possibly driving declines in both survival and size [@seitz2019; @ohlberger2019]. However, research specific to Chinook salmon in the Bering Sea is limited.

## Adult

While data pertaining to the adult marine life stage is relatively scarce, the resulting condition and size of salmon entering freshwater is easily observed, which has led to hypotheses that foraging conditions in the Bering Sea have declined in recent decades. The availability of high quality prey for adult Chinook salmon foraging in the Bering Sea is likely mediated by both bottom-up and top-down processes. It has been hypothesized that warmer temperatures have resulted in declining prey quality for Chinook salmon in the Eastern Bering Sea as they stage for spawning migration, potentially causing thiamine deficiency [@howard2023]. While it is not known how food webs have shifted as the Bering Sea has changed with climate change, bottom-up effects via salmon prey resources are thought to be widespread among Pacific salmon populations. Yukon Chinook salmon may also be experiencing increasing direct or indirect competition with increasingly abundant wild and hatchery pink salmon in the Being Sea [@feddern2024; @lamborn2025]. While pink and Chinook salmon typically occupy a different tropic niche [@johnson2009], pink salmon are highly efficient foragers that are capable of causing trophic cascades (top-down effects) that affect many levels of marine food webs [@ruggerone2023; @ruggerone2016]. Suboptimal prey and increased competitors for Chinook salmon combined with contractions in suitable ocean habitat due to climate change [@abdul-aziz2011] may all contribute to continued degradation of habitat conditions for Yukon Chinook salmon later in their marine life.
