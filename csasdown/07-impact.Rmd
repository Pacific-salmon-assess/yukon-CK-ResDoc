# IMPACT OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT MEASURES {#sec:impact}

## CLOSED LOOP SIMULATION MODEL

We developed a simple closed loop forward simulation, conditioned on our estimates of historical spawner abundance, harvest, age composition and time-varying productivity (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-schematic)). This model was then used to shed light on expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures (i.e., Harvest Control Rules [HCRs]). The simulation started in the last year for which we had empirical observations (2024) and projected the dynamics of individual Conservation Units forward in time. In each year of the simulation, the model (1) generated a forecast of aggregate returns (with empirically based forecast error), (2) applied a given HCR (see fishery sub-model description below) with outcome uncertainty because management control is not perfect, and (3) allowed remaining fish to spawn and then return in subsequent years across a range of ages at maturity.

Details on model components and calculation of performance are provided in the sections below.

### OPERATING MODEL

The operating model was used to simulate future population trajectories for the nine CUs to which we were able to fit spawner-recruitment models. The operating model projected their population dynamics forward over 26 years (i.e., to 2050, approximately four Chinook salmon generations), thereby generating a posterior predictive distribution of future states conditioned on the historical data. By simulating Yukon Chinook salmon dynamics in this manner, we ensured that predicted future spawner abundance and age structure were conditioned on the incomplete cohorts at the end of the data series (i.e., those cohorts from which one or more older age classes have not yet returned to spawn) and that uncertainties in the spawner-recruit relationships were propagated through time (i.e., by drawing from the posterior distributions of each estimated parameter and abundance state in each iteration of the simulation).

Population dynamics were assumed to be driven by @ricker-1954 type spawner-recruitment relationships:

\begin{equation}
  \ln(R_{i,y}) = \ln(S_{i,y}) + \ln(\alpha_i) - \beta S_{i,y} + v_{i,y}
  \label{eq:AR1-ricker-main}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is productivity (intrinsic rate of growth) and $\beta$ is the magnitude of within brood year ($y$) density-dependent effects for CU $i$. Inter-generational variation in survival, $\sigma_{i,y}$, was modeled as a multivariate normal vector:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{i,y} \sim \mathcal{MVN}\left(\mathbf{0}, \Sigma_R\right)
  \label{eq:var-covar}
\end{equation}

where the root diagonal of the covariance matrix $\Sigma_R$ is the CU specific inter-generational variation in survival and where correlation in the recruitment residual time series vectors $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_k$ between CU $i$ and $k$ ($\rho_{i,k}$) is captured in the off-diagonal covariance elements of $\Sigma_R$.

Returns in calendar year $t$, $N_{t,i}$, were then modeled as a function of the proportion of individuals that mature and return at each age:

\begin{equation}
  N_{t,i} = \sum_{a=4}^{7} R_{(t-a)} p_{(a-3)}
  \label{eq:totalreturn-main}
\end{equation}


where $p$ is the maturity schedule composed of four age classes (ages four through seven). In each year of the forward simulation, the number of spawners in Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker-main) was calculated as the total return (Equ. \@ref(eq:totalreturn-main)) minus aggregate harvest which was determined according to the harvest control rules described in the following section.

In each iteration of the forward simulation (n = 1000) the operating model was parameterized by taking a draw from the joint posterior distributions of the relevant parameters from the spawner-recruitment models with time-varying intrinsic productivity fit to each CU (Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker)-\@ref(eq:tv-alpha)). In our base, or reference, scenario, we projected system dynamics forward using a 10-year average of the most recent time-varying $\alpha$ estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-scenarios)). As a robustness test we also projected the system forward in time assuming intrinsic productivity was instead equal to the last empirical estimate of time varying productivity (2017 brood year) which serves as a test of the consequences of alternative harvest management measures if productivity were to remain severely depressed for the next several generations (~60% on average lower than most recent decade average; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-scenarios)) .

### FISHERY SUB-MODEL

In each year of the simulation total returns were assumed to be forecasted with error. This error was assumed to be lognormally distributed with a mean equal to the true run size and a standard deviation of 0.79 based on a retrospective assessment of the mid-point of preseason forecasts and true run size 2000-present [@JTC2025Report]. Forecasted returns were then used as an input into a given HCR that specified a target exploitation rate given the expected run-size. Outcome uncertainty (i.e., deviations from targeted catch due to imperfect management control) was then applied to calculate realized catch, where outcome uncertainty was assumed to be equal to a CV of 10%.

The specific harvest control rules we considered are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-hcrs) and described in Table \@ref(tab:hcrs). These alternative fishery management measures ranged from a no fishing scenario to illustrate expected recovery potential, to fixed exploitation rate rules intended to simply illustrate the expected impact of a range of harvest rates, to escapement goal type rules (with and without caps on maximum exploitation) that were intended to approximate a range of general harvest management strategies. Conservation Units were assumed to be equally vulnerable to harvest and harvest control rules were defined by a combination of a lower management reference point and/or an upper reference point and a maximum removal reference, all defined at the stock aggregate scale. When there was both a lower and upper reference point, harvest rates linearly increase from zero at spawner abundances below the lower reference point to the maximum removal reference at run sizes equal to the spawner abundances associated with the upper reference point. The maximum removal reference was never allowed to exceed 80% under any HCR because this is the maximum estimated aggregate harvest rate to have been experienced by the stock (occurred in 1987).

### PERFORMANCE MEASURES

We quantified the expected performance of current and alternative harvest management measures against biological and fishery objectives and associated quantitative performance measures (Table \@ref(tab:tab-perf-metrics-descriptions)). The primary biological objectives we considered related to minimizing the number of CUs below their lower biological reference points, and maximizing the number of CUs above their proposed rebuilding targets (upper biological reference points). We assumed that maximizing returns is the main biological objective for the system in its current state, so we based these lower and upper (rebuilding) reference points on our estimates of spawner abundance associated with maximum recruitment (20%$S_{MSR}$ and $S_{MSR}$) rather than maximum sustainable yield ($S_{MSY}$), because we considered them to be better aligned with Indigenous and ecosystem based management principles and the concept of “take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem” [@reid2022protecting]. We derived these reference points from the egg-mass and recruitment models (Appendix \@ref(app:third-appendix)) such that they explicitly accounted for the decreased reproductive output of spawners observed in recent years. In addition to these CU status performance measures we also calculated average annual aggregate escapement.

Fishery related performance measures included average annual total harvest and realized harvest rates, the proportion of years when no harvest occurred, and the proportion of years minimum Yukon First Nation harvest objectives were met. Yukon First Nations Basic Needs Allocation (BNA) for Chinook salmon have not been finalized and so we used 10,000 fish as the minimum harvest objective which is the interim allocation of Chinook salmon reserved for Yukon First Nations within the current Canadian fishery management strategy [@dfo2024yukonifmp]. We made the simplifying assumption that Yukon First Nations would be given priority access to any harvest opportunities but recognize that in reality under the harvest sharing provisions of the Yukon River Salmon Agreement some portion of harvest, even when at low levels, would occur in Alaska.  

## CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT AND ALTERNATIVE HARVEST MANAGEMENT MEASURES

Under a "no fishing" scenario, median spawner abundances were projected to exceed CU specific lower reference points for all CUs by 2050, and three CUs were projected to meet or exceed their upper reference points over the same time period: Middle Yukon, Big Salmon, and Upper Yukon (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-projections)).

Simulations across a range of fixed harvest rates highlighted a clear tradeoff between mixed-stock fishery harvests and risks to component CUs. Aggregate harvests were projected to be maximized at mixed-stock harvest rates of \~50%, and dominated by harvest from the Middle Yukon and Teslin CUs, but this comes at the cost of the three least productive CUs being below their lower biological reference points and hence at an elevated risk of extinction (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ER-tradeoff-ref)).

The current moratorium on fishing (at run-sizes below 71,000) allowed for some population growth and hence modest opportunities for harvest in forward projections (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-projections)). Specifically, annual harvest rates averaged 15%, and harvest was projected to be \~10,000 fish on average per year, though this was highly variable from year to year and only 30% of years were expected to result in First Nations Basic Needs Allocation being met (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-perf-ref); Table \@ref(tab:tab-ref-perf-measures)). Under this scenario median spawner abundances were projected to exceed CU specific lower reference points for all CUs, and the Upper Yukon CU was projected to exceed its upper reference point. Placing a maximum harvest rate cap on this harvest control rule reduced average annual harvest rates and harvest slightly but otherwise had little impact on the biological performance measures.

The IMEG harvest control rule (i.e., interim management escapement goal of 42,500) resulted in the highest average harvest rates (\~25%) and harvest (\~17,500), and lowest aggregate spawner abundance (\~40,000), of the alternative fishery management measures considered. These higher harvests came at the cost of one CU being likely to fall below its lower biological reference point (Northern Yukon). Under this scenario \~50% of years were expected to result in First Nations Basic Needs Allocation being met and \~40% were expected to have complete fishery closures. Placing a maximum harvest rate cap on the IMEG harvest control rule reduced the average harvest rate to \~20%, increased the probability of meeting Basic Needs Allocation, and reduced the chances of any CUs falling below their lower biological reference point. Lastly, the Precautionary Approach (PA) alternative, which allowed harvest at lower abundances than the other harvest control rules, had similar biological performance and chances of meeting Basic Needs Allocation as the moratorium scenarios, but reduced the frequency of fishery closures from 1 in 2 to 1 in 10 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-perf-ref); Table \@ref(tab:tab-ref-perf-measures)).

All harvest control rules resulted in very limited opportunities for harvest under the robustness test where intrinsic productivity was assumed to remain severely depressed for the next several generations. As a result, biological performance was very similar across HCRs, and four CUs were projected to fall below their lower biological reference points by the end of the simulations, and one was projected to approach extinction (Table \@ref(tab:tab-rob-perf-measures)). While relative fishery performance varied slightly among HCRs similarly to under the reference scenario, absolute fishery performance was low in all cases under the depressed productivity scenario.
