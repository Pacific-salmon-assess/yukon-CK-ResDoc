# IMPACT OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT MEASURES {#sec:impact}

## CLOSED LOOP SIMULATION MODEL

We developed a simple closed loop forward simulation, conditioned on our estimates of historical spawner abundance, harvest, age composition and time-varying productivity (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-schematic)). This model was then used to shed light on expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures (i.e., Harvest Control Rules [HCRs]). The simulation started in the last year for which we had empirical observations (2024) and projected the dynamics of individual Conservation Units forward in time. In each year of the simulation, the model (1) generated a forecast of total returns to the Yukon Chinook SMU (with empirically based forecast error), (2) applied a given HCR (see fishery sub-model description below) with outcome uncertainty because management control is not perfect, and (3) allowed remaining fish to spawn and then return in subsequent years across a range of ages at maturity.

Details on model components and calculation of performance are provided in the sections below.

### OPERATING MODEL

The operating model was used to simulate future population trajectories for the nine Yukon River Chinook salmon CUs (those in the Yukon Chinook SMU) to which we were able to fit spawner-recruitment models. The operating model projected their population dynamics forward over 26 years (i.e., to 2050, approximately four Chinook salmon generations), thereby generating a distribution of future states conditioned on the historical data. By simulating Yukon Chinook salmon dynamics in this manner, we ensured that predicted future spawner abundance and age structure were conditioned on the incomplete cohorts at the end of the data series (i.e., those cohorts from which one or more older age classes have not yet returned to spawn) and that uncertainties in the spawner-recruit relationships were propagated through time (i.e., by drawing from the posterior distributions of each estimated parameter and abundance state in each iteration of the simulation).

Population dynamics were assumed to be driven by @ricker-1954 type spawner ($S$)-recruitment ($R$) relationships:

\begin{equation}
  \ln(R_{i,y}) = \ln(S_{i,y}) + \ln(\alpha_i) - \beta S_{i,y} + v_{i,y}
  \label{eq:AR1-ricker-main}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is productivity (intrinsic rate of growth) and $\beta$ is the magnitude of within brood year ($y$) density-dependent effects for CU $i$. Inter-generational variation in survival, $\sigma_{i,y}$, was modeled as a multivariate normal vector:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{i,y} \sim \mathcal{MVN}\left(\mathbf{0}, \Sigma_R\right)
  \label{eq:var-covar}
\end{equation}

where the root diagonal of the covariance matrix $\Sigma_R$ is the CU specific inter-generational variation in survival and where correlation in the recruitment residual time series vectors $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_k$ between CU $i$ and $k$ ($\rho_{i,k}$) is captured in the off-diagonal covariance elements of $\Sigma_R$.

Returns in calendar year $t$, $N_{t,i}$, were then modeled as a function of the proportion of individuals that mature and return at each age:

\begin{equation}
  N_{t,i} = \sum_{a=4}^{7} R_{(t-a)} p_{(a-3)}
  \label{eq:totalreturn-main}
\end{equation}


where $p$ is the maturity schedule composed of four age classes (ages four through seven). In each year of the forward simulation, the number of spawners in Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker-main) was calculated as the total return (Equ. \@ref(eq:totalreturn-main)) minus aggregate harvest which was determined according to the harvest control rules described in the following section.

In each iteration of the forward simulation (n = 1000) the operating model was parameterized by taking a draw from the joint posterior distributions of the relevant parameters from the spawner-recruitment models with time-varying intrinsic productivity fit to each CU (Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker)-\@ref(eq:tv-alpha)). In our reference (base) scenario, we projected system dynamics forward using the average $\alpha$ estimates of the six most recent completely observed brood years (2013--2018), which corresponds with the 6-year generation length for Yukon River Chinook salmon (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-scenarios)). As a robustness (alternative) scenario we also projected the system forward in time assuming intrinsic productivity was instead equal to the last empirical estimate of time varying productivity (2017 brood year) which serves as a test of the consequences of alternative harvest management measures if productivity were to remain severely depressed for the next several generations (~60% on average lower than most recent decade average; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-scenarios)). Finally, we include another robustness scenario where the system was projected forward using the median $\alpha$ estimates from all fully observed brood years (1985--2018), which illustrates the outcomes if the stock were to return to historically high productivity levels (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-scenarios)).

### FISHERY SUB-MODEL

In each year of the simulation, total returns were assumed to be forecasted with error. This error was assumed to be lognormally distributed with a mean equal to the true run size and a standard deviation of 0.79, based on a retrospective assessment of the mid-point of preseason forecasts and true run size 2000-present [@JTC2025Report]. Forecasted returns were then used as an input into a given HCR that specified a target exploitation rate given the expected run-size. Outcome uncertainty (i.e., deviations from targeted catch due to imperfect management control) was then applied to calculate realized catch, where outcome uncertainty was assumed to be equal to a CV of 10%. We do not simulate in-season management or forecast adjustments, therefore our simulations likely over-estimate uncertainty.

The harvest control rules (HCRs) we considered are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-hcrs) and described in Table \@ref(tab:hcrs). These alternative fishery management measures ranged from a no fishing scenario to illustrate expected recovery potential, to fixed exploitation rate rules intended to simply illustrate the expected impact of a range of harvest rates, to escapement goal type rules (with and without caps on maximum exploitation) that were intended to approximate a range of general harvest management strategies. Illustrative HCRs, including no fishing and fixed exploitation rates, were applied across all years and without accounting for incidental harvest. For all others, it was assumed that the current 7-year agreement ("moratorium") rule is in effect until 2030, after which another HCR can take effect. 

Fixed exploitation rate rules (i.e., moratorium, moratorium with cap, IMEG, IMEG with cap; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-hcrs)) were defined by lower boundaries that have been previously recommended or used in the system (Table \@ref(tab:hcrs)), and upper limits on exploitation rates equal to either the removal reference proposed here (for 'cap' HCRs, RR = 35%) to demonstrate the consequences of this as an upper limit, or the maximum estimated harvest rate experienced by the stock in 1987 (80%) to simulate no upper limit without allowing unrealistically high harvest. Another HCR ('PA alternative') uses the lower fisheries reference point and upper stock reference point (USR) we propose, with harvest rates linearly increasing from zero to the maximum removal reference at run sizes equal to the USR. Conservation Units were assumed to be equally vulnerable to harvest, and low levels of incidental harvest (~1000 fish) were assumed to occur even in years where the HCR being applied would call for a fishery closure.

### PERFORMANCE MEASURES

We quantified the expected performance of current and alternative harvest management measures against biological and fishery objectives and associated performance measures (Table \@ref(tab:tab-perf-metrics-descriptions)). We considered the primary biological objectives to be minimizing the number of CUs below their lower biological benchmarks, and maximizing the number of CUs above their upper biological benchmarks. We assumed that maximizing returns is the main biological objective for the system in its current state, so we based these lower and upper benchmarks on our estimates of spawner abundance associated with maximum recruitment (20%$S_{MSR}$ and 40%$S_{MSR}$) rather than maximum sustainable yield ($S_{MSY}$), because we considered them to be better aligned with Indigenous and ecosystem based management principles and the concept of “take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem” [@reid2022protecting]. We derived these reference points from the spawner-recruitment models (Appendix \@ref(app:third-appendix)). We also calculated the number of CUs above their rebuilding target, which was (100%) $S_{MSR}$ based on egg mass recruitment models. In addition to these CU status performance measures, we also calculated average annual aggregate escapement.

Fishery related performance measures included realized total harvest, realized harvest rate, the proportion of years when the fishery closed, and average annual total harvest occurring in Canada. Under the harvest sharing provisions of the Yukon River Salmon Agreement, 20%--26% of total allowable catch should occur in Canada, which we simplified to a target of 23% in order to calculate the total Canadian harvest. Yukon First Nations Basic Needs Allocation (BNA) for Chinook salmon have not been finalized, but we used 10,000 fish, which is the interim allocation of Chinook salmon reserved for Yukon First Nations within the current Canadian fishery management strategy [@dfo2024yukonifmp]. Total harvest is compared with this figure where applicable.  

## CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT AND ALTERNATIVE HARVEST MANAGEMENT MEASURES

Under the reference productivity scenario and no fishing, median spawner abundances were projected to be at or below lower benchmarks from 2030--2050 for three CUs: Northern Yukon, White, and Pelly. Two CUs (Middle Yukon and Big Salmon) were projected to be between lower and upper benchmarks, and four more (Stewart, Upper Yukon, Teslin, and Nordenskiold) were above their upper benchmarks. Nordenskiold and Teslin approached or exceeded their CU-specific rebuilding targets (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-projections)).

Simulations across a range of fixed harvest rates highlighted a clear tradeoff between mixed-stock fishery harvests and risks to component CUs. Aggregate harvests were projected to be maximized at mixed-stock harvest rates of \~70%, and dominated by harvest from the Middle Yukon and Nordenskiold CUs, but at this harvest rate at least four CUs are projected to be extinct and another three below their lower biological benchmark and hence at an elevated risk of extinction (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ER-tradeoff-ref)).

The current moratorium on fishing at run-sizes below 71,000 allowed for populations to be stable and modest opportunities for harvest in forward projections under the reference productivity scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-projections)). Specifically, annual harvest rates averaged 10%, and total harvest was projected to be \~3,000 fish on average per year, though this was variable from year to year. Notably, this harvest control rule resulted in the fishery being closed to harvest in \~80% of years between 2030--2050. Harvest in Canada averaged \~600 fish per year, which does not meet the Yukon First Nations basic needs allocation (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-perf-ref); Table \@ref(tab:tab-ref-perf-measures)). Under this harvest control rule median spawner abundances were projected to exceed CU specific lower biological benchmarks for six CUs, and exceed upper biological benchmarks for four of those six. Placing a maximum harvest rate cap equal to the removal reference (RR) on this harvest control rule very slightly reduced average annual harvest rates and harvest slightly but otherwise had little impact on the biological performance measures.

The interim management escapement goal (IMEG) harvest control rule of 42,500 resulted in the highest average harvest rates (\~15%) and harvest (\~4,500), and lowest aggregate spawner abundance (\~25,000), of the alternative fishery management measures considered. These higher harvests resulted in the highest number of CUs falling below their lower biological benchmarks. Under this scenario \~70% of years were expected to have complete fishery closures. Placing a maximum harvest rate cap on the IMEG harvest control rule reduced the average harvest rate to \~12% and reduced the chances of any CUs falling below their lower biological reference point. Lastly, the Precautionary Approach alternative, which allowed harvest at lower abundances than the other harvest control rules, had similar biological performance to the moratorium scenarios, but reduced the frequency of fishery closures from four in five years (80%) to approximately one in four (25%, Figure \@ref(fig:fig-perf-ref), Table \@ref(tab:tab-ref-perf-measures)).

Under the robustness scenario where intrinsic productivity was assumed to remain severely depressed for the next several generations, all harvest control rules resulted in very limited opportunities for harvest and resulted in over half of CUs being extinct or at risk of extinction (Table \@ref(tab:tab-rob-perf-measures)). While relative fishery performance varied slightly among HCRs similarly to under the reference scenario, absolute fishery performance was low in all cases under the depressed productivity scenario.

Under the second robustness scenario where productivity was assumed to return immediately to its long-term average, all harvest control rules resulted in more positive fishery and biological outcomes. Under the IMEG rule, one CU was at risk of falling below its lower benchmark, but placing a cap on the maximum allowable harvest rate removed this risk (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-perf-rob2), Table \@ref(tab:tab-rob2-perf-measures)). Notably, this was the only harvest control rule and productivity scenario under which a basic needs allocation of 10,000 fish for Yukon First Nations was consistently met, assuming that Yukon First Nations got priority access to Canadian harvest.
