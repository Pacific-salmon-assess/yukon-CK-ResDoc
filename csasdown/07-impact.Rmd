# IMPACT OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT MEASURES {#sec:impact}


## CLOSED LOOP SIMULATION MODEL

We developed a simple closed loop forward simulation, conditioned on our estimates of historical spawner abundance, harvest, age composition and time-varying productivity (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-schematic)). This model was then used to shed light on expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures. The simulation started in the last year for which we had empirical observations (2024) and projected the dynamics of individual Conservation Units forward in time. In each year of the simulation, the model (1) generated a forecast of aggregate returns (with empirically based forecast error), (2) applies a given harvest control rule (HCR; see fishery sub-model description below), with outcome uncertainty because management control is not perfect, and (3) allows remaining fish to spawn.

Details on model components and calculation of performance are provided in the sections below.

### OPERATING MODEL

The operating model was used to simulate future population trajectories for the nine CUs for which we were able to fit spawner-recruitment models. The operating model projected their population dynamics forward over 26 years (i.e., to 2050, approximately four Chinook generations), thereby generating a posterior predictive distribution of future states conditioned on the historical data. By simulating Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon dynamics in this manner, we ensured that predicted future spawner abundance and age structure were conditioned on the incomplete cohorts at the end of the data series (i.e., those cohorts from which one or more older age classes have not yet returned to spawn) and that uncertainties in the spawner-recruit relationships were propagated through time (i.e., by drawing from the posterior distributions of each estimated parameter and abundance state in each iteration of the simulation).

Population dynamics were assumed to be driven by @ricker-1954 type spawner-recruitment relationships: 

\begin{equation}
  \ln(R_i,y) = \ln(S_i,y) + \ln(\alpha_i) - \beta S_i,y + v_i,y
  \label{eq:AR1-ricker-main}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is productivity (intrinsic rate of growth and $\beta$ is the magnitude of within brood year ($y$) density-dependent effects for CU $i$. Inter-generational variation in survival, $\sigma_{i,y}$, was modeled as a multivariate normal vector:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{i,y} \sim \mathcal{MVN}\left(\mathbf{0}, \Sigma_R\right)
  \label{eq:var-covar}
\end{equation}

where the root diagonal of the covariance matrix $\Sigma_R$ is the CU specific inter-generational variation in survival and where correlation in the recruitment residual time series vectors $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_k$ between CU $i$ and $k$ ($\rho_{i,k}$) is captured in the off-diagonal covariance elements of $\Sigma_R$.

Returns in year $t$, $N_{t,i}$, were then modeled as a function of the proportion of individuals that mature and return at each age: 

\begin{equation}
  N_{t,i} = \sum_{a=4}^{7} R_{t-a} p_{a-3}
  \label{eq:totalreturn-main}
\end{equation}

where $p$ is the maturity schedule composed of four age (ages four through seven). In each year of the forward simulation, the number of spawners in Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker-main) was calculated as the total return (Equ. \@ref(eq:totalreturn-main)) minus aggregate harvest which was determined according to the harvest control rules described in the following section.

In each iteration of the forward simulation (n = 500) the operating model was parameterized by taking a draw from the joint posterior distributions of the relevant parameters from the spawner-recruitment models with time-varying intrinsic productivity fit to each CU (Equ. \@ref(eq:AR1-ricker)-\@ref(eq:tv-alpha)). In our base, or reference, scenario, we project system dynamics forward using a 10-year average of the most recent time-varying $\alpha$ estimates. We ran another scenario where the most recent $\alpha$ estimate is used, and these two scenarios represent alternative assumptions about the capability of the system's productivity to recover by 2050. 

### FISHERY SUB-MODEL

In each year of the simulation total returns were assumed to be forecasted with error. This error was assumed to be lognormally distributed with a mean equal to the true run size and a standard deviation of 0.79 based on a retrospective assessment of the mid-point of preseason forecasts and true run size 2000-present [@JTC2025Report]. Forecasted returns were then used as an input into a given harvest control rule that specified a target exploitation rate given the expected run-size. Outcome uncertainty (i.e., deviations from targeted catch due to imperfect management control) was then applied to calculate realized catch, where outcome uncertainty was assumed to be equal to a CV of 10%.

The specific harvest control rules considered are detailed in Table X (**Table and Figure: HCRs considered**) and ranged from a no fishing scenario to illustrate expected recovery potential, to fixed exploitation rate rules intended to simply illustrate the expected impact of a range of harvest rates, to escapement goal type rules (with and without caps on maximum exploitation) that were intended to approximate a range of realistic harvest management strategies. Conservation Units were assumed to be equally vulnerable to harvest and harvest control rules were defined by a combination of a lower management reference point, an upper reference point and a maximum removal reference, all defined at the stock aggregate scale. When there is both a lower and upper reference point, harvest rates linearly increase from zero at spawner abundances below the lower reference point to the maximum removal reference at run sizes equal to the spawner abundances associated with the upper reference point. The maximum removal reference was never allowed to exceed 80% in any scenarios because this is the maximum estimated aggregate harvest rate to have been experienced by the stock [occurred in 1987; @JTC2025Report].


### PERFORMANCE MEASURES

<!-- sections below require links to figures, and definitely some editing... -->

We quantified the expected performance of current and alternative harvest management measures against biological and fishery objectives and associated quantitative performance measures (Table \@ref(tab-perf-metrics-descriptions)). The primary biological objectives we considered related to minimizing the number of CUs below their lower biological reference points, and maximizing the number of CUs above their proposed rebuilding targets (upper biological reference points). We assumed that maximizing returns is the main biological objective for the system in its current state, so we based these lower and upper (rebuilding) reference points on our estimates maximum recruitment (20% of $S_{MSR}$ and $S_{MSR}$) rather than maximum sustainable yield ($S_{MSY}$), which prioritizes harvest and can be misaligned with Indigenous worldviews. We derived these reference points from the egg-mass and recruitment models (Appendix \@ref(app:third-appendix)) such that they explicitly accounted for the decreased reproductive output of spawners observed in recent years. In addition to these CU specific performance measures we also calculated average annual aggregate escapement.

Fishery related performance measures included the proportion of years when no harvest occurred, and the proportion of years minimum Yukon First Nation harvest objectives were met. Yukon First Nations Basic Needs Allocation (BNA) for Chinook salmon have not been finalized and so we used 10,000 fish as the minimum Yukon First Nation harvest objective which is the interim allocation of Chinook salmon reserved for Yukon First Nations within the current Canadian fishery management strategy [@IFMP2025]. We also calculated average annual total harvest and realized harvest rate. 

## CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT AND ALTERNATIVE HARVEST MANAGEMENT MEASURES

Under a "no fishing" scenario, median spawner abundances exceeded the upper stock reference ($S_{MSR}$) by 2050 for three CUs: Middle Yukon and tribs., Nordenskiold, and Yukon R. Teslin Headwaters. Under the "status quo" harvest control rule (harvest allowed after 42500 spawners), spawner abundances were ~50% lower consistently, and hovered near the LSR for one CU (Northern YK). The modified status quo HCR with a 40% exploitation rate cap was an intermediate. Under two "moratorium" scenarios, where harvest is allowed only after 71,000 spawners, most CUs were between reference points from 2030-2050 (Teslin and Middle YK were at USR). The "alternative" harvest control rule, which allowed harvest at lower run sizes (19000) but increased exploitation rates slowly to a maximum of 40%, resulted in similar spawner trajectories to the moratorium scenarios. In most cases, spawners increased to 2030 and remained relatively stable thereafter. 

The projected total harvest varied among harvest control rules, with the "status quo" HCR allowing for the most harvest overall and the "moratorium with cap" allowing for the least. Median annual harvest in the status quo scenario was ~ 17000 fish, and ~8000 in the moratorium with cap. The proportion of years where the basic needs allocation was met was highest for the status quo scenario with 40% exploitation rate cap, at just under 60%. In this scenario, ~30% of years did not allow for harvest. The alternative HCR, which allowed harvest at the lowest run sizes, had the lowest proportion of no-harvest years (~15%) while maintaining the second-highest total escapement. 

We also included harvest scenarios where a fixed exploitation rate was applied, for illustrative purposes. Figure X (tradeoffs) demonstrates the differences among CUs and their spawner/harvest trade-offs. For example, the Yukon River-Teslin Headwaters CU has higher productivity and therefore resilience to high exploitation rates. For most smaller CUs (Northern Yukon, White, Stewart), peak harvest occurs at ~50% exploitation rate, and at 60% both harvest and spawners are decreasing. At a 60% exploitation rate, over half of CUs are below their LSR. 

Under the alternative assumption that $\alpha$ remains in its current depressed state, outcomes were generally poorer. Under all HCRs, five CUs remained below the LSR, and the number of spawners in the Pelly and White CUs approached zero. Almost no harvest was allowed under any scenario, with the median annual harvest being <2000 in all cases and years without harvest approaching 100% in several scenarios. Again, the alternative HCR allowed for moderate harvest and fewer years without harvest while maintaining comparable levels of escapement to other years.

The fixed exploitation rate analyses under the depressed $\alpha$ shows similar trade-offs, but with many fewer spawners and lower harvest. Harvest is maximized at lower levels even for larger/more productive CUs. At a 60% fixed exploitation rate, half of the CUs are extinct.

This analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs between harvest opportunity and maximizing fish on the spawning grounds, in the context of the current (and potential future) stock dynamics and demographic characteristics. Current levels of productivity allow for very little harvest without increasing the risk of extinction for one or more CUs, and management of the stock in the coming decades should reflect that while acknowledging that carefully chosen harvest control rules can allow for low levels of harvest to satisfy socio-cultural needs without much risk, even with uncertainty in forecasting and actual harvest.
