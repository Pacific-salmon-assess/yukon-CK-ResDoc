abstract: |
  The Yukon River is one of the largest and most remote salmon producing rivers in the world. Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) from the river have supported subsistence and First Nations fisheries for millennia, and commercial and recreational fisheries for over a century. Within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River basin Chinook salmon make up two Stock Management Units (SMUs; Yukon Chinook and Porcupine), comprising 12 Conservation Units (CUs) and over a hundred spawning locations. We used genetic information and run reconstruction models to estimate spawner abundances for the nine Yukon River CUs in the Yukon Chinook SMU from 1985 to 2024.  These estimates were combined with age composition and harvest data to characterize population dynamics, estimate biological benchmarks, assess CU status, and quantify expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures via closed loop simulations. Returns to the Yukon Chinook SMU declined ~87% over the past four decades culminating in five of the lowest returns on record in 2020--2024. Five of the nine CUs in the Yukon Chinook SMU, and two of three CUs in the Porcupine SMU, were assessed as in the Red status zone under the Wild Salmon Policy and so both SMUs are considered to be below their CU-status based Limit Reference Points. Aggregate Yukon Chinook SMU spawner abundances over the most recent generation (2019--2024) averaged ~25,000 which is well below a proposed Upper Stock Reference point and rebuilding target of 86,000 spawners. Declines in female Chinook salmon age at maturity, and to a lesser extent the proportion of females in the spawning population, have led to declines in reproductive output per spawner (~25% from the late 1980s to the early 2020s). Intrinsic productivity has also declined by ~ 60% over this same time period in the Yukon Chinook SMU. Leading hypotheses for factors driving the declines in both SMUs include heat stress and *Ichthyophonus* infection during spawning migrations, and climate induced changes to predator, prey, and competitor abundances in the Bering Sea ecosystem in which Yukon Chinook salmon spend much of their marine life. Simulations for the Yukon Chinook SMU suggest that under the current moratorium on fishing (at aggregate run sizes less than 71,000), spawner abundances are projected to exceed CU-specific lower biological benchmarks for six of nine CUs by 2050 and that there could be modest, but infrequent, harvest opportunities. Alternative harvest management measures (e.g., lower escapement goals, caps on maximum harvest rates) were projected to influence rebuilding potential and harvest opportunities to varying degrees, but alternative assumptions about future productivity were far more consequential. Data limitations precluded reconstructing the dynamics of Chinook salmon from CUs in the Porcupine SMU. We conclude by describing key knowledge gaps and areas of potential future work for both SMUs.
