    abstract = {Yukon River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha are described as having a “stream‐type” life history strategy. After emergence from river gravel, juveniles typically feed and grow in tributary streams of the Yukon River throughout their first summer, overwinter in freshwater, and usually leave their rearing areas for marine waters during the second spring or summer. Nonnatal rearing has been described in the upper Canadian portion of the drainage, but information is lacking for downstream U.S. waters. In 2006–2007, a study was conducted to document nonnatal rearing and the genetic origin of Chinook salmon in U.S. tributary streams of the Yukon River. Eight nonspawning streams were selected for study, seven located in a 260‐km segment between the U.S.–Canada border and Circle, Alaska, and one located 742 km downstream from the border. Age‐0 juveniles were captured in all eight streams. Genetic stock composition analyses using 13 standardized microsatellite loci assigned the fish to Canadian source populations. The Carmacks region (over 460 km upstream from the border) contributed 91\% to the mixtures in 2006 and 82\% in 2007. Canadian stocks nearest the border and from large river systems were underrepresented in the collections. Simulation and known‐origin mixture analyses demonstrated that stock composition and individual assignment estimates derived from the genetic baseline were accurate and precise. Some juveniles may have traveled over 1,200 km to reach rearing areas in U.S. waters. Future studies would help define the importance of this life history strategy to the overall health and productivity of Yukon River Chinook salmon.},

	abstract = {Wildlife populations are experiencing shifting dynamics due to climate and landscape change. Management policies that fail to account for non‐stationary dynamics may fail to achieve management objectives. We establish a framework for understanding optimal strategies for managing a theoretical harvested population under non‐stationarity. Building from harvest theory, we develop scenarios representing changes in population growth rate (r ) or carrying capacity (K ) and derive time‐dependent optimal harvest policies using stochastic dynamic programming. We then evaluate the cost of falsely assuming stationarity by comparing the outcomes of forward projections in which either the optimal policy or a stationary policy is applied. When K declines over time, the stationary policy leads to an underharvest of the population, resulting in less harvest over the short term but leaving the population in a higher‐value state. When r declines over time, the stationary policy leads to overharvest, resulting in greater harvest returns in the short term but leaving the population in a lower and potentially more vulnerable state. This work demonstrates the basic properties of time‐dependent harvest management and provides a framework for evaluating the many outstanding questions about optimal management strategies under climate change.

	abstract = {Accounting for population diversity can be critical to the sustainable management of mixed-stock fisheries because harvest rates that can be sustained by productive populations may come at the cost of overfishing less productive ones. While these harvest–diversity trade-offs are well-recognized, their consequences for harvest policy performance are not often explicitly evaluated in contemporary fisheries management. We use closed-loop simulations to evaluate the ability of alternative harvest policies to meet population diversity and fishery objectives for one of the largest subsistence Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fisheries in the world (Kuskokwim River Basin in western Alaska). We found clear evidence of population diversity that resulted in asymmetric trade-offs among fishery and conservation objectives whereby policies that forgo relatively small amounts of harvest result in relatively large increases in equitable access to Chinook and elimination of risk of weak stock extirpation. The performance of alternative harvest policies, and the magnitude of trade-offs, were sensitive to regime shifts and uncertainty in the drivers of recruitment variation. However, we found that harvest policies that prioritized meeting minimum subsistence needs were unlikely to jeopardize long-term sustainability.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used dynamic factor analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America’s west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

	abstract = {We describe an age-structured state-space model for stock–recruit analysis of Pacific salmon data. The model allows for incorporation of process variation in stock productivity, recruitment, and maturation schedules, as well as observation error in run abundance, harvest, and age composition. Explicit consideration of age structure allows for realistic depiction of system dynamics and sample design, more complete use of recent data, and forecasts that consider sibling relationships. A Bayesian framework is adopted, implemented with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which provides an enhanced ability to incorporate auxiliary information, convenient and rigorous consideration of measurement error and missing data, and a more complete assessment of uncertainty. We fit the model to annual upstream weir counts, commercial and recreational harvest estimates, and age composition data from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Karluk River, Alaska. For the case study, the model is configured with a Ricker stock–recruit relationship, autoregressive lag-1 productivity, and Dirichlet age-at-maturity. Details of alternate configurations are also described. We introduce the optimal yield probability profile as an objective tool for informing the selection of escapement goals based on yield considerations and describe alternative versions useful for addressing other management questions.},

Although this type of uncertainty may be large, it is seldom incorporated into simulation models that evaluate management options. One objective of this study was to quantify the deviations that occur between realized and target mortality rates (i.e., the target fraction of adult recruits that die each year during return migration, mostly due to harvesting) in fisheries for sockeye salmon from the Fraser River, British Columbia. We found that for some sockeye stocks, realized mortality rates were higher than targets when recruitment was low (resulting in conservation concerns) and lower than targets when recruitment was high (resulting in foregone catch). Scientists and managers can at least partially account for effects of such deviations between realized and target mortality rates (outcome uncertainties) by choosing target harvest rules that reflect typical patterns in those deviations. We derived a method to permit modelers to incorporate those patterns into analyses of management options.},

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have experienced widespread declines in mean age and size throughout their North American range. We investigated the consequences of declines in body size for spawner reproductive potential in terms of total egg mass per female. Our case study is the Yukon River where Chinook salmon have supported subsistence, commercial, and recreational fisheries. Using historical observations on individual body size from throughout the Yukon River and the relationship between female size and total egg mass from the Canadian portion, we estimate a decline in average female reproductive potential of 24\%–35\% since the 1970s. Because spawner abundances and the population sex ratio have not shown clear trends over time, our results suggest a reduced total population reproductive potential. Changes in spawner quality should be considered when developing management reference points, and conservation of population demographic structure may be necessary to sustain productive Chinook salmon systems.},

After model fitting, the spawning stock size that produces the maximum sustainable yield (S{MSY}) to a fishery, and the harvest corresponding to it (U{MSY}), are two of the most common biological reference points of interest to fisheries managers. However, to date there has been no explicit solution for either reference point because of the transcendental nature of the equation needed to solve for them. Therefore, numerical or statistical approximations have been used for more than 30 years.

We compared a suite of state-space models of varying structural complexity to simpler regression-based approaches and, as an example case, fitted them to data from 13 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in the Kuskokwim drainage in western Alaska. We found biological and policy conclusions were largely consistent among state-space models but differed strongly from regression-based approaches. Simulation trials illustrated our state-space models were largely unbiased with respect to spawner–recruit parameters, abundance states, and derived biological reference points, whereas the regression-based approaches showed substantial bias. These findings suggest our state-space model shows promise for informing harvest policy evaluations of harvest–biodiversity trade-offs in mixed-stock salmon fisheries.},

	abstract = {Changes over time in age, sex, and length-at-age of returning Pacific salmon have been widely observed, suggesting concurrent declines in per capita reproductive output. Thus, assessment models assuming stationary reproductive output may inaccurately estimate biological reference points that inform harvest policies. We extended age-structured state-space spawner–recruit models to accommodate demographic time trends and fishery selectivity to investigate temporal changes in reference points using Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We illustrate that observed demographic changes have likely reduced per capita reproductive output in an additive manner, for example, models including changes in both length-at-age and age composition showed larger declines than models incorporating only one time trend. Translated into biological reference points using a yield-per-recruit algorithm, we found escapement needed for maximum sustained catch has likely increased over time, but the magnitude further depended on size-selective harvest (i.e., larger increases for reference points based on larger mesh gillnets). Compared to traditional salmon assessments, our approach that acknowledges demographic time trends allows more complete use of available data and facilitates evaluating trade-offs among gear-specific harvest policies.},
