# STOCK STATUS AND TRENDS

## DATA SOURCES 

A detailed review of assessment projects for Yukon Chinook salmon is provided in @pestal_review_2022. This data review spanned assessment projects for Chinook salmon across the Yukon River Basin including mainstem passage (e.g., sonar, fishwheels, and mark-recapture projects), tributary spawning escapement (e.g., weir, tower, aerial, and sonar projects), harvest estimation, and associated biological sampling (e.g., genetics and age, sex, and length information for stock apportionment). 

Briefly, the number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the mainstem Yukon River has been estimated using a variety of methods over the past four decades. Fish wheels and a mark-recapture program were operated in several locations near the border (at White and Sheep rocks) from the early 1980s to the mid 2000s to estimate abundance and collect biological samples. In 2005, a sonar site and drift gillnet test fishery were established at Eagle, Alaska, to also estimate border passage and collect biological samples, and this assessment project has continued to present. Within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River spawning escapement has been enumerated a various tributaries using foot, aerial, and sonar based assessment methods (appendix figure X: tributary time series; appendix table x: tributaries, corresponding CUs, time-series length?). Many of these assessment projects have changed methods over time and/or have been relatively short in duration. The number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the Porcupine River has been estimated using sonar since 2014.

Surface trawl surveys targeting juvenile Chinook in the northern Bering Sea have been used most years since 2003 to derive an estimate of the abundance of Yukon River salmon stocks (Canadian, middle Yukon, and lower Yukon) during their first summer at sea [@murphy2023]. These data have been used forecast adult returns [@JTC2025Report], understand juvenile Chinook marine ecology, and shed light on life stage specific drivers of survival [@howard2023; @cunningham2018]. However, because the juvenile surveys are unable to estimate contributions of individual CUs to overall abundance we did not explicitly incorporate these data in our analyses.      

Harvest of Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon has historically occurred in commercial, subsistence, recreational, and Food Social and Ceremonial fisheries. In Alaska, harvest of Chinook salmon was historically apportioned to lower, middle and upper/Canadian stocks, by age, using scale pattern analysis. Since 2003 harvest of Yukon Chinook salmon in Alaska by age and stock of origin has been estimated using genetic methods. In Canada, harvests have been estimated from commercial landings, recreational catch cards, and from communal harvest information provided by individual First Nation Lands and Resources staff to DFO. 

Yukon River Canadian-origin salmon are caught as bycatch in Bering Sea Aleutian Island (BSAI) groundfish fisheries along with other salmon stocks from Alaska, the west coast of Canada and the United States, eastern Asia, and Russia. The Canadian stock has typically made up a relatively small percentage (2%–5%) of the total catch in recent years (2011–2016) and is estimated to be on average ~1% of total return, per year [@ianelli_chinook_2018; @connors_estimates_2023]. Because harvest in BSAI fisheries is a relatively minor portion to total returns, and because estimates of harvest are not available for all years, we did not explicitly account for it in our analyses.         

Biological information on Canadian origin Yukon Chinook has been collected annually from the fish wheels at White and Sheep rocks (most years from 1985–2008) and the gillnet test fishery at Eagle (2005–present) to determine fish age, sex, and length. Samples have typically been taken over the annual upstream adult migration period, with the number of samples taken each day roughly proportional to daily passage [@connors_incorporating_2020]. Genetic material has been recovered from 150-300 archived scale samples for most years 1985-2005, and since then 500-1500 tissue samples have been taken per year for genetic stock assignment. Genetic material from individual fish samples have been used to assign fish to one of nine Conservation Units via microsatellite markers (1985-2016) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; 2017-present)(Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix)).

A state-space run reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model for the Canadian stock aggregate was recently developed [@connors_estimates_2023]. It is fit to data from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvests, tributary escapements, stock-proportions, and age-composition. This model has been used to derive annual estimates of total harvest, escapement and returns, by age, for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon [@JTC2025Report].

## RUN RECONSTRUCTION AND SPAWNER-RECRUITMENT MODELS 

We reconstructed spawner abundance and population dynamics at the Conservation Unit (CU) scale following the approach described in @connors_incorporating_2020: (1) estimate daily CU composition (i.e., proportion of daily total abundance assigned to each of nine CUs) in test fisheries at the US-Canada border via molecular analyses of archived scale and tissue samples collected from returning spawners; (2) estimate annual CU-specific border passage and abundance via a state-space run-reconstruction model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and CU composition; and (3) characterize CU scale population dynamics nd estimate reference points by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner (or egg mass) recruitment models to estimated spawner abundances, harvest, and age composition. Details on the molecular analyses,  run-reconstruction model, and spawner-recruitment analyses and estimation of reference points are detailed in Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix), \@ref(app:second-appendix), and \@ref(app:third-appendix), respectively . 

## REFERENCE POINTS

### CONSERVATION UNIT SCALE
At the CU scale several biological reference points, or benchmarks, have been established to assess status under the Wild Salmon Policy [WSP; @holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009]. These include a WSP lower biological benchmark ($S_{GEN}$) which delineates red and amber status zones and is defined as the spawning abundance that is expected to lead to recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation in the absence of fishing under equilibrium conditions. This reference point is meant to identify when there is high risk of irreversible harm to the CU and is aligned with a COSEWIC assessment of “endangered”. The WSP upper biological benchmark (80%$S_{MSY}$) is used to delineate amber and green WSP biological status zones, and is defined as 80% of the spawner abundance associated with maximum sustainable yield under equilibrium conditions. These two benchmarks ($S_{GEN}$ and 80%$S_{MSY}$) are typically used to assess WSP biological status when there is sufficient data to estimate spawner-recruitment relationships at the CU scale, however, alternatives can and have been used in more data limited contexts (e.g., 20% of $S_{MSR}$, spawner abundance associated with maximum recruitment, as a proxy for the lower WSP benchmark). 

While the use of MSY-based reference points under the Wild Salmon Policy and DFO’s Precautionary Approach framework is consistent with international standards, the approach is has been criticized for potentially failing to meet broader socio-ecological objectives, or take Indigenous Knowledge systems and ecosystem based management principles into account [e.g., @frid2023re]. These reference points also typically do not explicitly take into account changing reproductive potential due to shifts in size and/or age structure, which is widespread in Pacific salmon. For these reasons there have been calls to reimagine the reference points used to be more inclusive of Indigenous and ecosystem-based management principles.

For Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon we used the standard lower ($S_{GEN}$) and upper (80%$S_{MSY}$) WSP biological benchmarks to formally assess WSP biological status for CUs by applying the rapid status assessment framework for Pacific salmon under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (@pestal2023state). This was necessary to adhere to the approach established in the rapid status assessment framework, to ensures consistency in application of status assessments across salmon Conservation Units in the Pacific Region, and to inform the CU status based Limit Reference Point that is required at the Stock Management Unit scale (see next section).

We also used alternative lower (20%$S_{MSR}$) and upper ($S_{MSR}$) biological reference points, based on analyses that explicitly take changes in demographic change into account, to quantify rebuilding potential and the biological consequences of alternative fisheries management scenarios (Section \@ref(#sec:impact)). We argue these reference points are better aligned with Indigenous and ecosystem based management principles and the concept of “take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem” [@reid2022protecting] because they are not tied to concept of maximum sustainable yield and, because they are associated with lower fishery removals, are expected to provide greater socio-ecological resilience in the face of future environmental uncertainty. 

### STOCK MANAGEMENT UNIT SCALE 

A Limit Reference Point, Upper Sock Reference Point, and Maximum Removal Reference need to be defined for the Yukon Chinook Stock Management Unit (SMU) to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act [@bill201968]. 

The Limit Reference Point (LRP) represents the stock status below which serious harm may occur to the stock and where there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and/or a long-term loss of fishing opportunities [@barrett2024technical]. Regional and national DFO guidance is that LRPs for salmon SMUs should be ‘CU [Conservation Unit] status-based’ to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act [@holt2023guidelines]. This means that a SMU is below its LRP if any component CUs are below their lower biological benchmark and hence in the ‘red’ status zone. The Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status framework [@pestal2023state] is the default approach to formally assess the WSP status of each CU in an SMU in order to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act.

The Upper Stock Reference (USR) point is the aggregate SMU spawner abundance at which socio-ecological objectives for the system are expected to be met, and above which maximum allowable harvest rates (Removal Reference Point) can be sustained. The USR should be set at an appropriate distance above the LRP to provide (a) sufficient opportunity for the management system to recognize a declining stock status and (b) time for management actions (e.g., reduced harvest) to have effect. The Removal Reference is the maximum acceptable harvest rate the SMU can be subject to and is typically set to be less than or equal to the removal rate associated with maximum sustainable yield ($U_{MSY}$). 

Other aggregate abundance based reference points can be defined for an SMU. A "lower stock reference point" is the aggregate SMU spawner abundance below which all fishery removals should be limited to the maximum extent possible and below which there is a high risk of serious and irreversible harm to the stock. This is referred to as a lower management reference point to avoid confusion with the CU status-based LRP above. This type of reference point is helpful for informing management since assessment and fishery decisions are often abundance based and so can be operationalized.

We used a CU-status based LRP to formally assess SMU status relative to the LRP per national guidance where CU statuses are based on applying the rapid status assessment framework for Pacific salmon under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy [@pestal2023state]; Appendix \@ref(app:fourth-appendix)]. 

We propose a lower stock reference point of 20% of $S_{MSR}$ for the stock aggregate, when changes in demographics are explicitly taken into account [~ 19,000 spawners based on @connors_estimates_2023]. To be consistent with the intent of the *Fisheries Act*, at aggregate returns below this reference point we propose that fishery removals be limited to the extent possible, while above the reference point removals can progressively be increased to the Removal Reference Point (the maximum removal rate when the Upper Stock reference point is met).

We propose an Upper Stock Reference point equal to $S_{MSR}$ for the stock aggregate, when changes in demographics are taken into account [~ 95,000 spawners based on @connors_estimates_2023] be used for the Stock Management Unit. This could be considered the aggregate spawner abundance at which socio-ecological objectives for the system are potentially maximized, and above which maximum allowable fishery removals could occur. We also propose that this also be used as the rebuilding target. 

We propose that both the lower fishery reference point and Upper Stock Reference point be based on analyses of the Canadian-origin stock aggregate and not analyses of component CUs. We propose this because we consider these to be the most scientifically defensible estimate of stock aggregate dynamics, and hence reference points, because they are based on an integrated run-reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model fit to data from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvests, tributary escapements, stock-proportions, and age-composition. In addition this model is used bilaterally under the Yukon River Agreement to derive annual estimates of total harvest, escapement and returns, by age, for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon. While this model does not explicitly take CU scale dynamics into account or consideration, the closed loop simulations undertaken in (Section \@ref(#sec:impact)) allow us to quantitatively evaluate the CU scale consequences of SMU reference points based on stock aggregrate analyses. 

Lastly we propose a maximum Removal Reference point for the stock aggregate t hat is equal to the long-term average $U_{MSY}$ for the least the productive CUs. Adhering to this reference point would ensure that maximum allowable fishery removals, in mixed-CU mainstem fisheries in Alaska and the Yukon, are unlikely to overfish the least productive CUs in the system.

All of the above reference points are proposed for the Yukon Chinook Salmon River SMU, and not the Porcupine SMU, or both SMUs combined. The reason for this is that there is very limited data for the Porcupine SMU (~10 observations of spawner abundance) which precluded us for characterizing it's dynamics and/or estimating biological reference points for it.
