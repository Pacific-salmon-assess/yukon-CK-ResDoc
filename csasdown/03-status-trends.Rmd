# STOCK STATUS AND TRENDS

## DATA SOURCES 

- general description of sources of data (spawners, harvest, age-comps, GSI)

A detailed review of assessment projects for Yukon Chinook salmon is provided in [@pestal_review_2022]. The data review spanned assessment projects for Chinook salmon across the Yukon River Basin including mainstem passage (e.g., sonar, fishwheels, and mark-recapture projects), tributary escapement (e.g., weir, tower, aerial, and sonar projects), harvest estimation, and associated biological sampling (e.g., genetics and age, sex, and length information for stock apportionment). 

Briefly, the number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the mainstem Yukon River has been estimated using a variety of methods over the past four decades. Fish wheels and a mark-recapture program were operated in several locations near the border (at White and Sheep rocks) from the early 1980s to the mid 2000s to estimate abundance and collect biological samples. In 2005, a sonar site and drift gillnet test fishery were established at Eagle, Alaska, to also estimate border passage and collect biological samples, and this assessment project has continued to present. Within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River spawning escapement has been enumerated a various tributaries using foot, aerial, and sonar based assessment methods. many of these assessment projects have changed methods over time and/or have been relatively short in duration. The number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the Porcupine River has been estimated using sonar since 2014.

Harvest of Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon has historically occurred in commercial, subsistence, recreational and Food Social and Ceremonial fisheries. In Alaska, harvest of Chinook salmon was historically apportioned to lower, middle and upper/Canadian stocks, by age, using scale pattern analysis. Since 2003 harvest of Yukon Chinook salmon in Alaska by age and stock of origin has been estimated using genetic methods. In Canada, harvests have been estimated from commercial landings, recreational catch cards, and from communal harvest information provided by individual First Nation Lands and Resources staff to DFO. 

Yukon River Canadian-origin salmon are caught as bycatch in Bering Sea Aleutian Island (BSAI) groundfish fisheries along with other salmon stocks from Alaska, the west coast of Canada and the United States, eastern Asia, and Russia. The Canadian stock comprises a relatively small percentage (2%–5%) of the total catch by year (2011–2016) and is estimated to be on average ~1% of total return, per year [@ianelli_chinook_2018; @connors_estimates_2023]. Because harvest in the BSAI fisheries is a relatively minor portion to total returns, and because estimates of harvest are not available for all years, we did not explicitly account for it in our analyses.         

Biological information on Canadian origin Yukon Chinook has been collected annually from the fish wheels at White and Sheep rocks (most years from 1985–2008) and the gillnet test fishery at Eagle (2005–present) to determine fish age, sex, and length. Samples have typically been taken over the annual upstream adult migration period, with the number of samples taken each day roughly proportional to daily passage (Appendix S1: Figure S1). Genetic material has been recovered from 150-300 archived scale samples for most years 1985-2005, and since then 500-1500 tissue samples have been taken per year for genetic stock assignment. Genetic material from individual fish samples have been used to assign fish to one of nine Conservation Units via microsatellite markers (1985-2016; Beacham et al. 2006; @connors_incorporating_2020) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; 2017-present; Beacham et al. 2018, DFO 2018; @connors_incorporating_2020)

In 2022 a state-space run reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model, fit to data from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvests, tributary escapements, stock-proportions, and age-composition was developed for the Canadian stock aggregate (@connors_estimates_2023). This model has been used  to derive annual estimates of total harvest, escapement and returns, by age, for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon (@JTC 2025).

## RUN RECONSTRUCTION AND SPAWNER-RECRUITMENT MODELS 

- general description of models used, details in Appendix A and B

Our approach to reconstructing Conservation Unit (CU) scale spawner abundance and population dynamics largely followed the approach described in @connors_incorporating_2020. It consisted of three general steps: (1) estimate daily CU composition (i.e., proportion of daily total abundance assigned to each of nine Conservation Units) in test fisheries at the US-Canada border via molecular analyses of archived scale and tissue samples collected from returning spawners; (2) estimate annual CU-specific border passage and abundance via a state-space run-reconstruction model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and CU composition from step one; and (3) characterize CU scale population dynamics by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner (or egg mass) recruitment models to estimated spawner abundances, harvest, and age composition. Details on the molecular analyses and run-reconstruction model are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix) and spawner-recruitment analyses are detailed in Appendix \@ref(app:second-appendix).
