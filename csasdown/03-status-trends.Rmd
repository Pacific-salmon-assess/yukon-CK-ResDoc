# STOCK STATUS AND TRENDS

## DATA SOURCES 

- general description of sources of data (spawners, harvest, age-comps, GSI)

## RUN RECONSTRUCTION AND SPAWNER-RECRUITMENT MODELS 

- general description of models used, details in Appendix A and B

## CU STATUS AND TRENDS 

- trends in escapement and harvest by CU (where possible) and recent escapements relative to benchmarks

- trends in demographics overall (b/c not CU specific data), impact of explicitly considering demographics in SR models and resulting benchmarks/status
- trends in productivity over time
- CU statuses based on WSP rapid status algorithm/assessment (Appendix C)

## SMU STATUS, TRENDS, AND REFERENCE POINTS 

- trends in escapement and harvest at SMU scale, status of SMU based on component CU WSP statuses
