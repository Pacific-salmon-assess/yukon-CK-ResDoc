# STOCK STATUS AND TRENDS

## DATA SOURCES

A detailed review of assessment projects for Yukon Chinook salmon is provided in @pestal_review_2022. This data review spanned assessment projects for Chinook salmon across the Yukon River Basin including mainstem passage (e.g., sonar, fishwheels, and mark-recapture projects), tributary spawning escapement (e.g., weir, tower, aerial, and sonar projects), harvest estimation, and associated biological sampling (e.g., genetics and age, sex, and length information for stock apportionment).

Briefly, the number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the mainstem Yukon River has been estimated using a variety of methods over the past four decades. Fishwheels and a mark-recapture program operated in several locations near the border (at White and Sheep rocks) from the early 1980s to the mid 2000s to estimate abundance and collect biological samples. In 2005, a sonar site and drift gillnet test fishery were established at Eagle, Alaska, to also estimate border passage and collect biological samples, and this assessment project has continued to present. Within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River, spawning escapement has been enumerated at various tributaries using foot, aerial, and sonar based assessment methods (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-trib-spawn))(appendix figure X: tributary time series; appendix table x: tributaries, corresponding CUs, time-series length?). Many of these assessment projects have changed methods over time and/or have been relatively short in duration. The number of adult Chinook salmon migrating into the Canadian portion of the Porcupine River has been estimated using sonar since 2014.

Surface trawl surveys targeting juvenile Chinook in the northern Bering Sea have been used most years since 2003 to derive an estimate of the abundance of Yukon River salmon stocks (Canadian, middle Yukon, and lower Yukon) during their first summer at sea [@murphy2023]. These data have been used forecast adult returns [@JTC2025Report], understand juvenile Chinook marine ecology, and shed light on life stage specific drivers of survival [@howard2023; @cunningham2018]. However, because the juvenile surveys are unable to estimate contributions of individual CUs to overall abundance we did not explicitly incorporate these data in our analyses.

Harvest of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon has historically occurred in commercial, subsistence, recreational, and Food Social and Ceremonial fisheries. In Alaska, harvest of Chinook salmon was historically apportioned to lower, middle and upper/Canadian stocks, by age, using scale pattern analysis. Since 2003 harvest of Yukon Chinook salmon in Alaska by age and stock of origin has been estimated using genetic methods. In Canada, harvests have been estimated from commercial landings, recreational catch cards, and from communal harvest information provided by individual First Nation Lands and Resources staff to DFO.

Yukon River Canadian-origin salmon are caught as bycatch in Bering Sea Aleutian Island (BSAI) groundfish fisheries along with other salmon stocks from Alaska, the west coast of Canada and the United States, eastern Asia, and Russia. The Canadian stock has typically made up a relatively small percentage (2%–5%) of the total catch in recent years (2011–2016) and is estimated to be on average \~1% of total return, per year [@ianelli_chinook_2018; @connors_estimates_2023]. Because harvest in BSAI fisheries is a relatively minor portion to total returns, and because estimates of harvest are not available for all years, we did not explicitly account for it in our analyses.

Biological information on Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook has been collected annually from the fish wheels at White and Sheep rocks (most years from 1985–2008) and the gillnet test fishery at Eagle (2005–present) to determine fish age, sex, and length. Samples have typically been taken over the annual upstream adult migration period, with the number of samples taken each day roughly proportional to daily passage [@connors_incorporating_2020]. Genetic material has been recovered from 150–300 archived scale samples for most years between 1985–2005, and since then 500–1500 tissue samples have been taken per year for genetic stock assignment. Genetic material from individual fish samples have been used to assign fish to one of nine CUs via microsatellite markers (1985–2016) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; 2017–present)(Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix)).

A state-space run reconstruction and spawner-recruitment model for the Canadian stock aggregate was recently developed [@connors_estimates_2023]. The model is fit to data from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvests, tributary escapements, stock proportions, and age composition and has been used to derive annual estimates of total harvest, escapement and returns, by age, for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon [@JTC2025Report].

## RUN RECONSTRUCTION AND SPAWNER-RECRUITMENT MODELS

We reconstructed spawner abundance and population dynamics at the CU scale following the approach described in @connors2022. This approach consisted of three overarching steps: (1) estimate daily CU composition (i.e., proportion of daily total abundance assigned to each of nine CUs) in test fisheries at the US-Canada border via molecular analyses of archived scale and tissue samples collected from returning spawners; (2) estimate annual CU-specific border passage and abundance via a state-space run-reconstruction model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and CU composition; and (3) characterize CU scale population dynamics and estimate reference points by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner (or egg mass) recruitment models to estimated spawner abundances, harvest, and age composition. Details on the molecular analyses, run-reconstruction model, and spawner-recruitment analyses and estimation of reference points are detailed in Appendix \@ref(app:first-appendix), \@ref(app:second-appendix), and \@ref(app:third-appendix), respectively. 

## REFERENCE POINTS

### CONSERVATION UNIT SCALE

Several biological reference points, or benchmarks, have been established at the CU scale to assess status under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP; @holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009). These include a WSP lower biological benchmark ($S_{GEN}$) which delineates red and amber status zones and is defined as the spawning abundance that is expected to lead to recovery to $S_{MSY}$ in one salmon generation in the absence of fishing under equilibrium conditions. This reference point is meant to identify when there is high risk of irreversible harm to the CU and is aligned with a COSEWIC assessment of “endangered”. The WSP upper biological benchmark (80%$S_{MSY}$) is used to delineate amber and green WSP biological status zones, and is defined as 80% of the spawner abundance associated with maximum sustainable yield under equilibrium conditions. These two benchmarks ($S_{GEN}$ and 80%$S_{MSY}$) are typically used to assess WSP biological status when there is sufficient data to estimate spawner-recruitment relationships at the CU scale, however, alternatives can and have been used in more data limited contexts (e.g., 20% of $S_{MSR}$, spawner abundance associated with maximum recruitment, as a proxy for the lower WSP benchmark). (Table \@ref(pars-ref-pts))

While the use of MSY-based reference points under the Wild Salmon Policy and DFO’s Precautionary Approach framework is consistent with international standards, the approach is has been criticized for potentially failing to meet broader socio-ecological objectives, or take Indigenous Knowledge systems and ecosystem based management principles into account [e.g., @frid2023re]. These reference points also typically do not explicitly take into account changing reproductive potential due to shifts in size and/or age structure, which is widespread in Pacific salmon. For these reasons there have been calls to reimagine the reference points used to be more inclusive of Indigenous and ecosystem-based management principles.

For Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon we used 20% and 40% of $S_{MSR}$ as lower and upper biological benchmarks to formally assess WSP biological status for Yukon Chinook CUs by applying the rapid status assessment framework for Pacific salmon under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (@pestal2023state). These benchmarks tend to be more biologicaly conservative than $MSY$ based ones, while still being consistent with the intent of upper and lower benchmarks under the WSP and in their application to status assessments across salmon CUs in the Pacific Region.

We also used alternative lower (20%$S_{MSR}$) and upper ($S_{MSR}$) biological reference points, based on analyses that explicitly take changes in demographic change into account, to quantify rebuilding potential and the biological consequences of alternative fisheries management scenarios (Section \@ref(#sec:impact)). We argue these reference points, and the upper one in particular, are better aligned with Indigenous and ecosystem based management principles and the concept of “take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem” [@reid2022protecting] because they are not tied to concept of maximum sustainable yield and, because they are associated with lower fishery removals, are expected to provide greater socio-ecological resilience in the face of future environmental uncertainty.

### STOCK MANAGEMENT UNIT SCALE

A Limit Reference Point, Upper Sock Reference Point, and Maximum Removal Reference need to be defined for the Yukon Chinook Stock Management Unit to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act [@bill201968].

The Limit Reference Point (LRP) represents the stock status below which serious harm may occur to the stock and where there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and/or a long-term loss of fishing opportunities [@barrett2024technical]. Regional and national DFO guidance is that LRPs for salmon SMUs should be ‘CU [Conservation Unit] status-based’ to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act [@holt2023guidelines]. This means that a SMU is below its LRP if any component CUs are below their lower biological benchmark and hence in the ‘red’ status zone. The Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status framework [@pestal2023state] is the default approach to formally assess the WSP status of each CU in an SMU in order to meet the Fish Stocks provisions of the Fisheries Act.

The Upper Stock Reference (USR) point is the aggregate SMU spawner abundance at which socio-ecological objectives for the system are expected to be met, and above which maximum allowable harvest rates (Removal Reference point) can be sustained. The USR should be set at an appropriate distance above the LRP to provide (a) sufficient opportunity for the management system to recognize a declining stock status and (b) time for management actions (e.g., reduced harvest) to have effect. The Removal Reference is the maximum acceptable harvest rate the SMU can be subject to and is typically set to be less than or equal to the removal rate associated with maximum sustainable yield ($U_{MSY}$).

Other aggregate abundance based reference points can be defined for an SMU. A "lower fishery reference point" is the aggregate SMU spawner abundance below which all fishery removals should be limited to the maximum extent possible and below which there is a high risk of serious and irreversible harm to the stock. This is referred to as a lower fisahery reference point to avoid confusion with the CU status-based LRP above. This type of reference point is helpful for informing management since assessment and fishery decisions are often abundance based and so can be operationalized.

We used a CU-status based LRP to formally assess SMU status relative to the LRP per national guidance where CU statuses are based on applying the rapid status assessment framework for Pacific salmon under Canada's Wild Salmon Policy [@pestal2023state]; Appendix \@ref(app:fourth-appendix)].

We propose a lower stock reference point of 20% of $S_{MSR}$ for the stock aggregate, when changes in demographics are explicitly taken into account [\~ 19,000 spawners based on @connors_estimates_2023]. To be consistent with the intent of the *Fisheries Act*, at aggregate returns below this reference point we propose that fishery removals be limited to the extent possible, while above the reference point removals can progressively be increased to the Removal Reference point (the maximum removal rate when the Upper Stock Reference point is met).

We propose an Upper Stock Reference point equal to $S_{MSR}$ for the stock aggregate, when changes in demographics are taken into account [\~ 95,000 spawners based on @connors_estimates_2023] be used for the Stock Management Unit. This could be considered the aggregate spawner abundance at which socio-ecological objectives for the system are potentially maximized, and above which maximum allowable fishery removals could occur. We also propose that this also be used as the rebuilding target.

We propose that both the lower fishery reference point and Upper Stock Reference point be based on analyses of the Canadian-origin stock aggregate and not analyses of component CUs. We propose this because we consider these to be the most scientifically defensible estimate of stock aggregate dynamics, and hence reference points, because they are based on an integrated run-reconstruction and spawner-recruitment models fit to data from various assessment projects that estimate mainstem passage, harvest, tributary escapements, stock proportions, and age composition. In addition this model is used bilaterally under the Yukon River Agreement to derive annual estimates of total harvest, escapement and returns, by age, for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon. While this model does not explicitly take CU scale dynamics into account or consideration, the closed loop simulations undertaken in Section \@ref(#sec:impact) allow us to quantitatively evaluate the CU scale consequences of using these SMU reference points based on stock aggregate analyses.

Lastly we propose a maximum Removal Reference point for the stock aggregate that is equal to the long-term average $U_{MSY}$ for the least productive CUs. Adhering to this reference point would ensure that maximum allowable fishery removals, in mixed-CU mainstem fisheries in Alaska and the Yukon, are unlikely to overfish the least productive CUs in the system.

All of the above reference points are proposed for the Yukon Chinook Salmon River SMU, and not the Porcupine SMU, or both SMUs combined. The reason for this is that there is very limited data for the Porcupine SMU (\~10 observations of spawner abundance) which precluded us for characterizing it's dynamics and/or estimating biological reference points for it.

## CONSERVATION UNIT STATUS AND TRENDS

### RUN-TIMING AND RECONSTRUCTED SPAWNER ABUNDANCES

Run-timing, as inferred by the timing of passage from Alaska into the Yukon Territory, varied among CUs (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-run-timing)). Conservation Units with Chinook that spawn in the lower (more northern) portion of the Canadian Yukon River Basin tended to return, on average, earlier than those in the upper (more southern) portions of the basin. The upper river mainstem spawning CUs (Middle Mainstem and Upper Lakes and Mainstem) tended to return later than the Teslin CU that includes Chinook that spawn the furthest upriver, and Chinook form the Nordenskoild CU tended to have the latest, and most variable, run-timing. This run timing variation results in an average return migration that is about two times longer (~70 days) than the average across the individual CUs (~35 days).

All CUs exhibited considerable inter-annual variation in reconstructed spawner abundance over time (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-CU-spawn)). The Middle Yukon CU had on average the largest spawning abundances (~12,000) followed by the Pelly (~8,000) and Northern Yukon (~7,000) CUs. The Upper Yukon (~3,000) and Nordenskiold (~2,000) CUs had the smallest average spawner abundances. Across CUs spawner abundances in the most recent generation (2018-2024) were on average 37% lower than that long-term average. The Pelly (-50%) and White (-59%) CUs have experienced the largest magnitude declines while spawner abundance in the Upper Yukon CU over the most recent generation was similar to the long-term average. 

Reconstructed CU spawner abundances tended to correlate positively with tributary scale assessments of spawner abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-trib-vs-CU-spawn)). Tributary assessments that indexed a larger fraction of the total CU and were higher precision methods (e.g., Tahkini and Klondike sonars, Tachun weir) tended to have the strongest positive correlations with reconstructed CU scale spawner abundances. One exception was the Whitehorse fishway that had little relationship with reconstructed spawner abundance for the Upper Yukon CU. 

### SPAWNER-RECRUITMENT RELATIONSHIPS
There is clear evidence of heterogeneity in intrinsic productivity and equilibrium abundance across CUs (Table \@ref(ref:pars-sr)). Estimates of intrinsic productivity ranged from 2.2 to 4.8 recruits-per-spawner and predicted equilibrium size ranged from from 3,900 to 18,400 spawners. These intrinsic productivities translate into harvest rates predicted to maximize long-term harvest (i.e., $U_{MSY}$) that range from ~35% to 61%. Most CUs showed some visual evidence of overcompensation with modestly declining recruitment at relatively high spawner abundances, and for many of the CUs the largest recruitment were observed in brood years with relatively low to moderate spawning abundances in the early part of the time series (1985–1995 brood years) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-CU-SR)). Interannal variation in recruitment was positively correlated among CUs (mean pairwise correlation of ~0.5) and was strongest (weakest) for CUs that were geographically closest (furthest) from each other. There is evidence of time-trends in recruitment and productivity over time (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-prod-trends)) with productivity having been estimated to have declined by an average of 60% across CUs between the late 1980s and the early 2020s. 

### ESCAPEMENT QUALITY
As has been well documented previously [@ohlberger_demographic_2018;@ohlberger_reproductive_2020;@connors_estimates_2023], age, size and sex ratios, as measured at the Alaska-Yukon border, have all changed over time (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-asl)). The proportion of returning fish that were sexed as female declined from an average of approximately 53% in the 1980s to 46% in the 2020s, with considerable interannual variation (as high as 59% in 1989 and low as 31% in 2023. Female size at age also declined for most ages with the exception of 6 year olds. Female Chinook salmon age composition has also changed considerably over time. In the 1980s, approximately 20% of females were seven year olds, 70% were six year olds, and fewer than 10% of females returned on average as five year olds. By the 2020s an average of 5% of females returned as seven year olds, 70% as six year olds and 25% as five year olds.

When one takes into account the relationship between female size and fecundity [@ohlberger_reproductive_2020], these observed demographic changes translate into a marked decline in average reproductive output per spawner. Specifically, the average total eggs per spawner declined by ~ 35% from the late 10980s to the early 2020s. 

These changes result in modest differences in the inferred shape of the relationship between reproductive output (i.e., spawners vs. total egg mass) and recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-CU-EMR)). Estimated time-trends in intrinsic productivity were qualitatively very similar between the two alternative reproductive output - recruitment models (**Figure: Trends in productivity by CU and recruitment model**. This suggests that observed declines in the number of recruits produced per spawner over time are predominantly driven by processes influencing survival (e.g., environmental and ecosystem processes) and not due to demographic changes. 

As a result of the observed declines in reproductive output, the spawner abundance expected to maximize recruitment ($S_{MSR}$), given recent (2015-2024) demographic characteristics, was estimated to be on average X% greater across all CUs than that estimated given historical (1985-1995) demographic characteristics (**Table of demographic reference points**). in contrast, $S_{MSR}$ given recent (2015-2024) demographic characteristics was estimated to be on average X% greater across all CUs when demographics change was not taken into account (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-demo-smsr)) but for several CUs estimates of $S_{MSR}$ corresponded to smaller spawner abundances when demographic change was explicitly accounted for (i.e., Big Salmon, Northern Yukon, Upper Yukon CUs). The reason why estimates were lower for some Cus may be due to subtly different shapes between the two alternative reproductive output (i.e., spawners vs. total egg mass) and recruitment relationships; CUs like Big Salmon and the Northern and Upper Yukon appeared to have more evidence for overcompensation and this could in turn result in estimates of the spawner abundance expected to maximize recruitment being lower as well. 

## WILD SALMON POLICY RAPID STATUS ASSESSMENTS
An assessment of CU biological statuses was carried out following the methods detailed in the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status framework [@pestal2023state]. The key input into these assessments were reconstructed spawner abundances over time and corresponding biological reference points (Table \@ref(ref:pars-sr)), and data inputs and resulting statuses were reviewed thorough a series of meetings with subject matter experts. 

Three CUs (Nordenskiold, Stewart, and White) were assessed as in the Red status zone due to spawner abundances over the most recent generation being below an absolute abundance lower threshold of 1,500 spawners. The Northern Yukon & Tributaries CU was assessed as in the Red status zone because spawner abundances over the most recent generation were below the lower biological reference point of 20%$S_{MSR}$. One additional CU, the Porcupine, was provisionally assessed as in the Red status zone due to a recent precipitous decline in spawner abundance, however the CU did not have sufficient data to meet minimum data standards (time series is too short <15 years with gaps) for formal application of the WSP rapid status approach. The WSP rapid status for other CUs in this SMU were assessed as in the Amber status zone.
