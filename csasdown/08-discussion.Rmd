## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

In this report we describe the current understanding of Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon stock structure and distribution, stock assessment history, and analyses that combine genetic stock identification of archived scale and tissue samples with  run-reconstruction models to estimate migration timing and annual return abundance for nine Conservation Units (CUs). We then characterized CU scale population dynamics and estimate biological reference points by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner (or egg mass) recruitment models to observations of spawner abundances, harvest, and age composition. Anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors affecting the stock are then described along with general rebuilding and enhancement activities that could contribute to stock growth. Lastly, quantitative estimates of the expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures were generated from a closed loop simulation model.

Aggregate returns of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook have declined in recent decades culminating in five of the lowest returns on record in 2021-2024. These declines have placed immense hardship on subsistence users and First Nations who depend on Yukon Chinook for food, social and cultural uses, and prompted a seven year moratorium on directed harvest in Alaska and Canada beginning in 2024. We found that variation among CUs in run timing results in an average return migration that is about two times longer (~70 days) than the average across individual CUs (~35 days). Declines in female Chinook salmon age at maturity, and to a lesser extent the proportion of females in the spawning population, have resulted in a marked decline in average reproductive output per spawner (~35% from the late 1980s to the early 2020s). Concurrent with these changes intrinsic productivity has declined by an average of 60% across CUs though it appears this decline has been largely driven by environment and ecosystem changes that have affected egg to adult survival.

Reconstructed spawner abundances at the CU scale were on average 37% lower in the most recent generation (2018-2024) than their long-term average (1985-2024). Three CUs (Nordenskiold, Stewart, and White) were assessed as in the Wild Salmon Policy Red status zone due to their spawner abundances being below an absolute abundance lower threshold of 1,500 spawners. The Northern Yukon & Tributaries CU was assessed as in the Red status zone because spawner abundances over the most recent generation were below it's lower biological reference point. One additional CU, the Porcupine, was provisionally assessed as in the Red status zone due to a recent precipitous decline in spawner abundance, however, the CU had a relatively short time series of observations. The remaining CUs were assessed as in the Amber status zone, though with low confidence due to potential unaccounted for migration mortality and uncertainties about how well spawner abundances could be reconstructed. 

At the SMU scale Chinook salmon run-sizes declined by ~65% between 1985-1995 and 2014-2024. Because multiple CUs were assessed as falling in the Red status zone the SMU is below it's CU-status based Limit Reference Point. Aggregate spawner abundances over the most recent generation averaged 25,852 which is slightly above a proposed lower fishery reference point of 19,000 and well below the proposed upper stock reference point of 95,000. Realized harvest rates over this same time period averaged 16%. 

The past decade has seen a considerable amount of research into anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors that may have contributed to the recent and long-term declines in body size and productivity of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon. Leading hypotheses for drivers of these changes include heat stress and *Ichthyophonus* infection during return migrations, and climate induced changes to predator, prey and competitor abundances in the Bering Sea ecosystem that Yukon Chinook spend much of their marine life in. Several enhancement activities have been directed towards Yukon Chinook over the past 40 years including hatcheries, incubation facilities, and in-stream incubation projects. These enhancement projects have been modest in nature and while there is general agreement that enhancement may support rebuilding efforts more research and work is needed to determine where enhancement could be effective and how to minimize the potential for adverse impacts. A range of stewardship and restoration activities have been implemented or considered for Yukon Chinook. These efforts include watershed and habitat protection, targeted monitoring programs, and cold-water refuge conservation, all aimed at promoting the long-term health and recovery of Chinook salmon returning to Canadian portion of the Yukon River basin.

Simulations suggest that the current moratorium on fishing at aggregate run sizes less than 71,000 allows for some stock growth and hence future harvest opportunities over the next 26 years. Spawner abundances are projected to exceed CU specific lower reference points for all CUs by the end of this time period, and three CUs are projected to exceed their upper reference points. Under this scenario harvest is projected to be ~10,000 fish on average per year (2030-2050) though this is highly variable from year to year and only 30% of years are expected to result in First Nations Basic Needs Allocation being met. Evaluation of the interim management escapement goal that was in place prior to the moratorium suggests that it can achieve higher average harvests but at the cost of one CU projected to fall below it's lower biological reference point and only two CUs projected to be above their upper biological reference points. Lastly, a Precautionary Approach compliant HCR, which allowed harvest at lower abundances than the other HCRs, had similar biological performance and chances of meeting Basic Needs Allocation as the moratorium HCR, but reduced the frequency of fishery closures from 1 in 2 to 1 in 10. These simulations assumed the intrinsic productivity of the CUs that make up the stock is depressed but remains the same as it has been over the last decade moving forward. Under an alternative worst-case scenario where productivity is assumed to be be severely depressed (X% below most recent decade average) all alternative harvest management measures considered resulted in very limited opportunities for harvest, and up to four CUs were projected to fall below their lower biological reference points by 2050.

## EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ASSESSMENT TRIGGERS FOR THE STOCK 
Exceptional circumstances are assessment triggers intended to proactively identify conditions and/or circumstances that may represent a substantial departure from those under which the advice in this assessment was developed (i.e., reassess model assumptions). 

In addition to routine re-assessment every generation to ensure stock status can be updated and captures contemporary fishery and biological processes, we recommend a re-assessment be triggered if any of the following occur:   

- Stock productivity changes drastically, where the median estimate of time-varying productivity (annual CU specific Ricker $\alpha$s) falls outside the 50th percentiles of the productivity used to condition our forward simulation under the robustness test;

- Management measures other than those evaluated in this research document are considered by Fisheries Management; 

- New information becomes available that results in changes to our understanding of stock-structure (e.g., the current Conservation Unit delineations) and/or major drivers of stock dynamics; or 

- New information becomes available that results in changes to the historical time-series of spawner abundance and/or catches used in this research document (e.g, historical estimates of migration mortality are derived and incorporated into the run-reconstructions.

## KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND AREAS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK  
As is inevitable with any analyses of large and complex ecological and fishery datasets, we had to make a number of simplifying assumptions. These include: Key assumptions:

1. **Assuming all Conservation Units have historically been equally vulnerable to fisheries**. Our reconstructions of CU scale harvests, and subsequent population dynamics modelling and estimation of reference points, relied on reconstructed estimates of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon harvest rates [@connors_estimates_2023] which were then used to calculate CU specific harvest based on reconstructed spawner abundance. This approach implicitly assumes that all CUs have historically experienced the same harvest rates. We consider this a reasonable assumption because Canadian-origin Chinook salmon are the first “pulse” of Chinook salmon to enter the Yukon River each year and subsistence and commercial fisheries (e.g., openings and closures and gear restrictions) have historically been managed by pulse. However, it is possible that differences in run timing, and the timing of fisheries during the first pulse in the lower river in Alaska, have led to earlier returning fish being more vulnerable to harvest than later returning fish. This has the potential to underestimate harvest rates for populations that return relatively early and overestimate harvest rates for those that return relatively late which in turn may under- and over-estimate productivity, respectively. However, the actual timing of lower river harvests has varied over time and is difficult to separate from the harvest of co-migrating Chinook salmon that spawn in the middle and lower portions of the Yukon River Basin. Thus, it may not be possible to accurately reconstruct the timing and magnitude of the gauntlet of commercial and subsistence fisheries that historically occurred and that Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon would have experienced along the length of the Yukon River.

2. **Assuming there has been no en-route adult migration mortality from the Alaska-Yukon Territory border to spawning grounds**.Our reconstructions of CU scale spawner abundances assumed that the only source of mortality after passing the border was harvest. However, elevated water temperatures and *Ichthyophonus hofori* disease have been identified as two relatively common stressors that may result in premature mortality of Yukon Chinook salmon throughout the U.S. or Canadian portions of the drainage during their adult spawning migrations [@von2020evidence; @biela2022premature; @connors_estimates_2023; @howard2023].Historical tagging studies of return adult Chinook salmon have found comparable movements and survival rates between years that had relatively cool, and warm, freshwater migration conditions [@eiler2023swimming]. However, a recently initiated tagging study undertaken as a collaboration between ADF&G, DFO and Yukon First Nations has preliminary found that ~20% of Upper Yukon and Teslin headwaters CU tagged fish (n=20) that migrated across the border into the Yukon Territory did not make it to their spawning ground. This work is ongoing, and based on few observations, so at present the magnitude of en-route adult migration mortality exhibited by Canadian Yukon Chinook on an annual basis is not known, but likely varies substantially in space and over time. Failing to account for en-route adult migration mortality in our CU run-reconstructions would result in overestimates of spawner abundance in years in which it occurs, and potential for  biologically optimistic estimates of CU status, and for this reason assessment of biological status for headwater CUs were deemed to be of low confidence. 

3. **Assuming Conservation Unit age composition can be approximated by Canadian-origin stock aggregate age composition**. Our CU scale spawner recruitment analyses we assumed all CUs shared a common age-at-return that varied through time. While there is undoubtedly some among-CU variation in age-at-return, this assumption was a necessary simplification due to the availability of age composition information at the CU level. Age composition data from fish sampled at the Alaska Yukon Territory border can be assigned to individual CUs from ~2005 to present but our ability to link genetic and age information for samples prior to 2005 was limited, and tributary scale age composition is very patchy. For those years where we can compare CU specific and aggregate age composition there is not strong qualitative evidence of differences in age composition among [@connors2022], but it is possible that relatively subtle among-CU differences in age composition could result in bias in our estimates of recruitment (which is the sum of fish that returned across ages for a given spawning cohort), which could in turn influence inferences about the shape of the spawner-recruitment relationship and resulting estimates of population productivity and abundance [@zabel2002simple] though these impacts may be relatively small [@peacock2020evaluating].   

4. **Assuming that future productivity will remain similar to that observed over past decade**. Our closed-loop simulation evaluation of alternative fishery management measures required us to make assumptions about what CU scale intrinsic productivity was likely to be over the course of the simulations. There is clear evidence of interannual variation and declines in intrinsic productivity over time and so we assumed that estimates of the last decade of CU specific productivity were a reasonable proxy for the coming decades. We also considered an alternative worst-case scenario where productivity is assumed to be be severely depressed (X% below most recent decade average) moving forward. Assumptions about intrinsic productivity will impact projection of recovery potential and fishery outcomes, and while both productivity scenarios we considered were based on empirical observations it is possible that productivity continues to decline further. 

There are several areas of assessment and research that warrant attention moving forward. Doing so can help to resolve key uncertainties and improve the scientific basis upon which management decisions are made. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Increased tributary scale assessment projects**. While the analytical work detailed in this report represents our best efforts to shed light on CU scale dynamics and status based on the patchwork of available information, quantitative models will not save the day and are no substitute for long-term investment in spawning grounds assessments at the tributary and/or CU scale.

- **Improved understanding of en-route migration mortality and its implications for CU assessment and evaluations of fishery management measures**. Given that the magnitude of en-route adult migration mortality exhibited by Canadian Yukon Chinook on an annual basis is not known, but likely varies substantially in space and over time, continued investment in telemetry assessment projects, and research into correlates of potential migration mortality back through time, will enable future evaluation of the consequences of accounting for this mortality on CU assessment and forward looking evaluations of fishery management measures. 

- **Climate and ecosystem informed life cycle modelling**. Assessments of juvenile Yukon Chinook abundances in the Bering sea have occurred for the past several decades. To date fish sampled in these surveys have only been genotyped to Canadian, middle Yukon, and lower Yukon stock groups and consideration should be given to whether they could be assigned (historically and/or moving forward) back to CUs in a manner similar to what we have detailed for adults sampled at the Alaska Yukon Territory border. Whether at the CU or simple stock aggregate scale these juvenile data can be used to inform life cycle models that could explicitly incorporate and update those ecosystem and environmental conditions that have previously been shown to correlate with Yukon Chinook productivity [@cunningham2018; @murdoch2024; @feddern2024]. When coupled with future projections of cliamte and ecosystem change such analyses may help shed light on future recovery potential and impacts of alternative management measures.       

- **Revisiting Conservation Unit delineations and measures of genetic diversity** The current CU delineations are based on a genetics baseline and analyses that are over a decade old [@holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007; @holtby2011]. These delineations should be revisited based on the updated genetics baseline collection, and updated evaluations of genetic evidence for population structure along with traditional and local ecological knowledge.
