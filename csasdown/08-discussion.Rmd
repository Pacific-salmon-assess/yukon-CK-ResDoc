## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

In this report we describe the current understanding of Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon stock structure and distribution, stock assessment history, and analyses that combine genetic stock identification of archived scale and tissue samples with  run-reconstruction models to estimate migration timing and annual return abundance for nine Conservation Units (CUs). We then characterized CU scale population dynamics and estimate biological reference points by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner (or egg mass) recruitment models to observations of spawner abundances, harvest, and age composition. Anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors affecting the stock are then described along with general rebuilding and enhancement activities that could contribute to stock growth. Lastly, quantitative estimates of the expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures were generated from a closed loop simulation model.

Aggregate returns of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook have declined in recent decades culminating in five of the lowest returns on record in 2021-2024. These declines have placed immense hardship on subsistence users and First Nations who depend on Yukon Chinook for food, social and cultural uses, and prompted a seven year moratorium on directed harvest in Alaska and Canada beginning in 2024. We found that variation among CUs in run timing results in an average return migration that is about two times longer (~70 days) than the average across individual CUs (~35 days). Declines in female Chinook salmon age at maturity, and to a lesser extent the proportion of females in the spawning population, have resulted in a marked decline in average reproductive output per spawner (~35% from the late 1980s to the early 2020s). Concurrent with these changes intrinsic productivity has declined by an average of 60% across CUs though it appears this decline has been largely driven by environment and ecosystem changes that have affected egg to adult survival.

Reconstructed spawner abundances at the CU scale were on average 37% lower in the most recent generation (2018-2024) than their long-term average (1985-2024). Three CUs (Nordenskiold, Stewart, and White) were assessed as in the Wild Salmon Policy Red status zone due to their spawner abundances being below an absolute abundance lower threshold of 1,500 spawners. The Northern Yukon & Tributaries CU was assessed as in the Red status zone because spawner abundances over the most recent generation were below it's lower biological reference point. One additional CU, the Porcupine, was provisionally assessed as in the Red status zone due to a recent precipitous decline in spawner abundance, however, the CU had a relatively short time series of observations. The remaining CUs were assessed as in the Amber status zone, though with low confidence due to potential unaccounted for migration mortality and uncertainties about how well spawner abundances could be reconstructed. 

At the SMU scale Chinook salmon run-sizes declined by ~65% between 1985-1995 and 2014-2024. Because multiple CUs were assessed as falling in the Red status zone the SMU is below it's CU-status based Limit Reference Point. Aggregate spawner abundances over the most recent generation averaged 25,852 which is slightly above a proposed lower fishery reference point of 19,000 and well below the proposed upper stock reference point of 95,000. Realized harvest rates over this same time period averaged 16%. 

The past decade has seen a considerable amount of research into anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors that may have contributed to the recent and long-term declines in body size and productivity of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook salmon. Leading hypotheses for drivers of these changes include heat stress and *Ichthyophonus* infection during return migrations, and climate induced changes to predator, prey and competitor abundances in the Bering Sea ecosystem that Yukon Chinook spend much of their marine life in. Several enhancement activities have been directed towards Yukon Chinook over the past 40 years including hatcheries, incubation facilities, and in-stream incubation projects. These enhancement projects have been modest in nature and while there is general agreement that enhancement may support rebuilding efforts more research and work is needed to determine where enhancement could be effective and how to minimize the potential for adverse impacts. A range of stewardship and restoration activities have been implemented or considered for Yukon Chinook. These efforts include watershed and habitat protection, targeted monitoring programs, and cold-water refuge conservation, all aimed at promoting the long-term health and recovery of Chinook salmon returning to Canadian portion of the Yukon River basin.

Simulations suggest that the current moratorium on fishing at aggregate run sizes less than 71,000 allows for some stock growth and hence future harvest opportunities over the next 26 years. Spawner abundances are projected to exceed CU specific lower reference points for all CUs by the end of this time period, and three CUs are projected to exceed their upper reference points. Under this scenario harvest is projected to be ~10,000 fish on average per year (2030-2050) though this is highly variable from year to year and only 30% of years are expected to result in First Nations Basic Needs Allocation being met. Evaluation of the interim management escapement goal that was in place prior to the moratorium suggests that it can achieve higher average harvests but at the cost of one CU projected to fall below it's lower biological reference point and only two CUs projected to be above their upper biological reference points. Lastly, a Precautionary Approach compliant HCR, which allowed harvest at lower abundances than the other HCRs, had similar biological performance and chances of meeting Basic Needs Allocation as the moratorium HCR, but reduced the frequency of fishery closures from 1 in 2 to 1 in 10. These simulations assumed the intrinsic productivity of the CUs that make up the stock is depressed but remains the same as it has been over the last decade moving forward. Under an alternative worst-case scenario where productivity is assumed to be be severely depressed (X% below most recent decade average) all alternative harvest management measures considered resulted in very limited opportunities for harvest, and up to four CUs were projected to fall below their lower biological reference points by 2050.

## EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ASSESSMENT TRIGGERS FOR THE STOCK 
- recommend frequency of reassessments then propose circumstances that would trigger a reassessment earlier (e.g., new proposed HCRs, broader range of objectives/performance measures, multiple years of very depressed productivity, end of fishing moratorium) 


## KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND AREAS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK  
Key assumptions:

1. population dynamics:
  + equal vulnerability to fisheries
  + no natural mortality after passing border: get stat on proportion of tagged fish from recent telemetry that made it past eagle and were detected on spawning grounds, as a rough estimate of potential en-route mortality in Canada. I know sample sizes are really small but it helps shed some modicum of light on the big assumption of the run-reconstructions models that border passage - CDN harvest = escapement
  + age comps reasonably approximated
  + future productivity

2. Management consequences
  + super simplified, points to recovery and rebuilding potential and framework for more exploration
