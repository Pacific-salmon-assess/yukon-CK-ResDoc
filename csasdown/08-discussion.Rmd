# DISCUSSION     {#sec:discussion}

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

- proposed reference points (LRP, USR, RR), SMU status; emphasize LRP is based on CU status but Lower Management Reference Point can be aggregate abundance based 

- recap performance of current and alternative harvest control rules, as well as rebuilding actions

- sensitivity to key axes of uncertainty (robustness tests)

## EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ASSESSMENT TRIGGERS FOR THE STOCK 
- recommend frequency of reassessments then propose circumstances that would trigger a reassessment earlier (e.g., new proposed HCRs, broader range of objectives/performance measures, multiple years of very depressed productivity, end of fishing moratorium) 


## KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND AREAS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK  
Key assumptions:
1. population dynamics:
- equal vulnerability to fisheries
- no natural mortality after passing border: get stat on proportion of tagged fish from recent telemetry that made it past eagle and were detected on spawning grounds, as a rough estimate of potential en-route mortality in Canada. I know sample sizes are really small but it helps shed some modicum of light on the big assumption of the run-reconstructions models that border passage - CDN harvest = escapement
- age comps reasonably approximated
2. Management consequences
- super simplified, points to recovery and rebuilding potential and framework for more exploration

Reality check: 
- make clear that IMEG model is probably closer to truth, but we needed to consider CUs and can treat out attempts to reconstruct as alternative hypotheses

Future work
-  genetics of juvenile surveys and deeper dive 
porcupine ref points

Assessment triggers:
- enough data for porcupine
