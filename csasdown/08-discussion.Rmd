## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

- proposed reference points (LRP, USR, RR), SMU status; emphasize LRP is based on CU status but Lower Management Reference Point can be aggregate abundance based 

- recap performance of current and alternative harvest control rules, as well as rebuilding actions

- sensitivity to key axes of uncertainty (robustness tests)

## EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR ASSESSMENT TRIGGERS FOR THE STOCK 
- recommend frequency of reassessments then propose circumstances that would trigger a reassessment earlier (e.g., new proposed HCRs, broader range of objectives/performance measures, multiple years of very depressed productivity, end of fishing moratorium) 


## KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND AREAS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK
