#  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    

We are thankful for the numerous technicians and biologists that have collected data on Yukon Chinook salmon for over 60 years in both the U.S. and Canada. Without their efforts the information and analyses we describe in this report would not have been possible.   
We thank Dan Greenberg for analytical advice, Luc Glover, and Marina Milligan for their input on assessment projects, Joe Tadey for providing additional hatchery context, Jaclyn Kendall and Steve Smith for helpful background context, and Cheyenne Bradley and Priyadarshini Dutta for feedback on an earlier version of this document, and Carmen Gemmell for creating the maps. Lastly, we thank Sue Grant for leading the Wild Salmon Policy rapid status assessments and all the individuals who contributed to them.
