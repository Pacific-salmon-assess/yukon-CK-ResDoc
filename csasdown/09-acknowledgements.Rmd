#  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    

We are deeply appreciative of the countless individuals and organizations that have collected data on Yukon Chinook salmon for over 60 years in both the U.S. and Canada. Without their efforts the information and analyses we describe in this report would not have been possible.   

We thank Dan Greenberg for analytical advice, Luc Glover and Marina Milligan for their input on assessment projects, Joe Tadey for providing additional hatchery context, Jaclyn Kendall and Steve Smith for helpful background context, Cheyenne Bradley and Priyadarshini Dutta for feedback on an earlier version of this document, and Carmen Gemmell for creating the maps. Eric Rondeau and Janine Supernault carried out the genetic analyses we relied upon for our work and Fred West provided historical forecasts and postseason run-size estimates that we based our forecast error estimates on. Sue Grant and Gottfried Pestal helped lead the Wild Salmon Policy rapid status assessments. Lastly, Carrie Holt, Zachary Liller, and Allison Dennert provided detailed and constructive reviews which along with feedback from participants at the Regional Peer Review meeting greatly improved the Research Document.
