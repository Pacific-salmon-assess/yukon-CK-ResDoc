# HABITAT {#sec:HABITAT}
## FRESHWATER HABITAT CONDITIONS

The terrain of Yukon includes mountains, plateaus, and valleys that support a diverse mosaic of forest, tundra, grassland, shrubland, and wetland ecosystems. Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are considered to be relatively intact across the Yukon watershed [@brabets2000environmental] and access to most of the watershed is limited to boat or aircraft. The Yukon River has considerable seasonable variability in environmental conditions, with summer flows substantially higher than winter flows [@brabets2000environmental]. Streamflows as low as 1,200 $m^3s^{-1}$ occur in the winter, and streamflow discharge pulses of more than 19,800 $m^3s^{-1}$ occur in the spring [@USGS2022]. The river freezes throughout the entire watershed in the winter and ice breakup occurs in late spring, typically by mid-May [@eiler2023swimming]. The mainstem river is relatively deep, greater than 20m in the lower river, but becomes shallower, 8--10m, in the Canadian portion of the drainage [@eiler2023swimming].

The freshwater habitats that Yukon Chinook salmon utilize are undergoing significant environmental transformations, and these changes are thought to play a role in the decline of their populations [@murdoch2024, @yukon2004ecoregions]. Chinook salmon migrating through the Yukon River basin regularly encounter water temperatures that induce stress responses (above 18$^\circ$C, @usepa2003) leading to reduced reproductive success [@murdoch2024, @von2020evidence]. Over the past several decades, earlier spring melt and shifts in river ice breakup timing have altered migration patterns and habitat availability for aquatic species [@yukon2004ecoregions, @bushlemmen2019]. Thawing permafrost and increased summer precipitation are contributing to higher stream flows, greater sedimentation, and more extreme weather events, which impact water clarity and quality. These changes are also contributing to unstable riverbanks, further degrading critical spawning and rearing habitats [@murdoch2024].

These environmental impacts are expected to intensify. More frequent and intense floods due to increased precipitation during the summer months could displace juvenile salmon from their rearing habitats, increasing mortality risks [@murdoch2024]. As glaciers retreat, summer water flows may become less predictable, with potential reductions in water availability during critical salmon migration periods [@yukon2004ecoregions]. Effects of glacial retreat on stream flow and timing have already been seen, notably in Kusawa Lake in southern Yukon [@zdanowicz2018] and in Kluane Lake and Slims River with the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier [@shugar2017river].

## POTENTIAL HABITAT RESTORATION AND MONITORING ACTIVITIES THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO STOCK REBUILDING

In response to the challenges faced by Chinook salmon across the Canadian portion of the Yukon and Porcupine watersheds, a range of stewardship and restoration activities have been implemented or are being considered. These efforts include watershed and habitat protection, targeted monitoring programs, and cold-water refuge conservation, all aimed at promoting the long-term health and recovery of Yukon Chinook salmon.

Protecting and restoring creeks and rivers, particularly those vulnerable to increased precipitation and sedimentation, is thought to be important for juvenile salmon survival [@murdoch2024]. Improved environmental monitoring can help to track stream temperatures, flow regimes, and sediment levels to detect early changes in freshwater survival conditions [@murdoch2024]. Yukon First Nations, Government of Yukon, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada are working to standardize temperature monitoring throughout the watershed.

Activities related to Chinook salmon habitat restoration and reclamation can include riparian zone restoration and enhancing spawning habitats, especially in areas of placer mining activities. Riparian zone restoration involves revegetating stream banks and adding large organic debris to stabilize banks and improve habitat quality, which provides shade, regulates water temperature [@kirkland2020, @varner2023], and contributes essential nutrients for salmon. Restoration and reclamation should also include improving floodplain connectivity and lateral stability [@varner2023, @chevrearuxclarkson2015]. Degraded riparian areas can lead to increased water temperatures and sedimentation, negatively affecting spawning and rearing habitats [@pusey2003importance].

Improving fish passage may also support habitat restoration efforts in some portions of the river basin. Barriers like dams and culverts can obstruct salmon migration routes, preventing access to spawning and rearing habitats. Water relicensing processes for the Mayo Generating Station and the Whitehorse Rapids Generating Station are underway, and public comment during both processes have called for installing fish passage [@yukonenergy2024mayo] and improving fish passage, respectively. Identifying and prioritizing barriers for remediation, designing and implementing fish passage solutions such as fish ladders or culvert replacements, and evaluating their success in facilitating salmon movement can be essential. Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association (YRDFA) identified multiple culverts of potential concern for salmon passage, highlighting the need for such assessments [@yrdfa2025springracs] and research has emphasized the need for connectivity between spawning habitats and unobstructed access to them [@brown2017, @isaak2007]. Additionally, there has been increasing scrutiny on passage barriers that beaver dams create, both for juveniles accessing non-natal streams and for returning spawners [@malison2016, @connors2016course].

Conservation and identification of cold-water refugia are also being considered to protect areas critical to salmon migration and spawning, especially as in-river temperatures rise. Migrating salmon rely on cooler, non-mainstem rivers to reduce stress during these warmer conditions [@murdoch2024, @eiler2023swimming, @von2020evidence]. Additionally, identification of groundwater sites used in rearing locations is critical, as groundwater supplies possibly impact nutrient loads when surface flows are frozen in the winter [@bradford2001]. Identification of juvenile habitat through eDNA or rotary screw traps can help to identify the groundwater locations and habitat to target for regulatory protection, and project to begin eDNA collection have begun throughout the watershed.

Furthermore, water quality is a vital component of habitat restoration efforts. Pollution and nutrient runoff can degrade water quality, affecting salmon health and survival [@gormley2005, @sergeant2022risks]. Identifying sources and levels of pollutants, and understanding their impact on salmon populations, are necessary to inform mitigation strategies. While much of the Yukon River watershed is minimally impacted from land use practices and wastewater management, gold and quartz mining are sources of water contaminants. In June 2024, a catastrophic failure at Victoria Gold's Eagle Mine heap leach pad resulted in a landslide releasing approximately 300 million liters of cyanide laden solution into the surrounding environment. This event led to elevated levels of cyanide, cobalt, copper, and nitrite in nearby water bodies, including a tributary of the McQuesten River, a known spawning system in the Northern Yukon CU [@yukongov2025].

A key aspect of any forward-looking restoration is to incorporate Indigenous Knowledge into restoration efforts, as Indigenous communities possess valuable traditional ecological knowledge that can contribute to grounded and impactful conservation strategies. For example, Indigenous Knowledge can provide essential insights into ecological baselines, such as historic indicators of salmon abundance (e.g., number of carcasses, smell along riverbanks), which are not captured through conventional monitoring methods [@connoy2024studying]. Complementing Indigenous Knowledge with western science confirmed the role of salmon as ecological and cultural keystone species and found that riparian tree growth and nitrogen enrichment was positively related to salmon escapement [@connoy2024studying].

Numerous projects funded through the Yukon River Panel's Restoration and Enhancement Fund are advancing stewardship and habitat restoration efforts across the Yukon River watershed. Additional funding mechanisms and projects are conducted throughout the watershed, though not touched on here. Habitat restoration initiatives such as the Fox Creek stream channel restoration and McIntyre Creek streambank stabilization aim to improve salmon habitat by addressing impacts of beaver dams and streambank erosion [@crawford2023foxcreek] and the Upper Mayo River restoration project works to rehabilitate degraded habitats [@mantykapringle2020beaver]. A project by the Whitehorse Rapids Fish Hatchery is working to maintain Chinook salmon populations impacted by the Whitehorse Rapids Dam [@whitehorse2023fishladder].

Monitoring projects underway or recently completed include the Michie Creek Salmon Monitoring Project, which tackles migration barriers for outmigrating Chinook [@jessup2024michie], and the Takhini River Chinook Restoration and Sonar Initiative, which employs drone and sonar technology to monitor Chinook populations [@hoogland2025takhini]. The Beaver River watershed Chinook survey [@mantykapringle2020beaver] focused on understanding Chinook population dynamics to inform conservation strategies while in the Porcupine River the Chinook Salmon Telemetry Project tracked migratory behavior using telemetry [@dfo2017porcupine, @edi2017porcupine]. Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in is monitoring Chinook salmon passage through sonar, and supporting community engagement, youth education, and stewardship through their First Fish initiative [@edi2023klondike, @vittrekwa2023firstfish].

These restoration projects also provided promising future directions for ecosystem recovery and stock rebuilding. For instance, drone surveys in the Takhini River will be expanded to identify critical habitats and improve species monitoring. A new sonar site on the Stewart River will assess hydrology, turbidity, and fish passage to support management. In the Klondike watershed, a revised restoration plan could pave the way for small community enhancement efforts. Temperature monitoring will be broadened in key migration corridors such as the Porcupine, Upper Pelly, and White rivers, as well work to identify cold-water refuges like the Big Salmon and White River tributaries. Planned sonar station upgrades and expanded telemetry studies will boost data reliability, aiding both population tracking and habitat restoration planning efforts.

Future efforts may also require changes to regulatory processes to protect salmon habitats. Key recommendations from other works include updating the Yukon River Watershed Authorization to reflect current science, addressing outdated habitat models, and fostering collaboration with Yukon First Nations and industry [@yssc2025]. Additionally, assessing cumulative impacts under key legislation like the Waters Act and modifying the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act process would allow for stronger salmon conservation measures [@yssc2025]. Removing the free-entry mining system and linking staking rights to development would enable more deliberate decision-making, incorporating environmental reviews and community input [@yssc2025]. These changes aim to strengthen governance and safeguard Yukon's salmon-bearing rivers.

Ultimately, targeting restoration efforts on those habitat that are hypothesized to be bottlenecks to salmon survival is likely to be the most impactful use of resources. In addition there is growing appreciation for the dynamic nature of salmon habitat and the importance of protecting and preserving the heterogenous and complex habitat landscapes that salmon use and the processes that generate them [@moore2022getting].
