# STOCK STRUCTURE, BIOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION {#sec:stock}

Chinook salmon that spawn within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River basin make up two Stock Management Units [SMU; @dfo2024yukonifmp], the Yukon River Chinook Salmon SMU and Porcupine Chinook Salmon SMU. These SMUs are comprised of twelve Conservation Units [CUs; Table \@ref(tab:tab-cons-unit-smu); @holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007;@holtby2011] which are are groups of salmon that are considered genetically and ecologically unique [@holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007] under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy [@WSP2005]. Nine CUs are from watersheds draining into the mainstem of the Yukon River and three from the Porcupine River that joins the Yukon River mainstem in Alaska. On average, the annual proportion of the total return of Chinook salmon to the Yukon River that are Canadian origin is 42% and has historically varied from 31%-54% [@JTC2025Report]. These Chinook salmon spawn in 15 major and 91 minor spawning locations throughout the Canadian portion of the watershed (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map-spawn); [@brown_catalog_2017]).

The Porcupine River basin, located in northern Yukon is comprised of three Chinook salmon CUs: Old Crow, Salmon Fork, and Porcupine (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map-spawn)). Little data exists from Chinook salmon from the Old Crow and Salmon Fork CUs, and spawning abundances in these CUs is believed to be very low. The Porcupine CU is the most abundant of the region and the only one subject to annual assessments (**DFO 2024**). Chinook salmon passage in the Porcupine River has been estimated using sonar since 2014, with an average annual estimate of 2,800 fish and a recent estimate of 468 in 2024 [@JTC2025Report].

Further south, along the mainstem Yukon River within Canada, nine CUs form a single SMU which contains the majority of Canadian Yukon River Chinook salmon (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map-spawn)). Spawner and return abundances among the CUs varies considerably and is primarily assessed via a monitoring and sampling program located near the U.S. / Canada border. In addition, there are assessment sites throughout the Canadian portion of the watershed, which in recent years have been operated by Yukon First Nations, Yukon Energy Corporation, or consultants [@JTC2025Report]. Sampling for genetics on the spawning grounds has helped support the development of a genetics baseline which has been used to determine population and CU delineations and has been used for genetic assignment of Canadian Yukon River Chinook salmon (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-map-gsi)).

Since the onset of the genetic sampling program in 1985, the Middle Yukon River and tributaries CU has averaged 43% of the Yukon River Chinook SMU (Table \@ref(tab:tab-cons-unit-smu); Table \@ref(tab:tab-CU-gsi-annual-summary)). During this time frame, the Pelly, North Yukon River and tributaries and Yukon River-Teslin headwaters CUs have averaged greater than 10% of the SMU, while the remaining CUs ranged 1-6%. The Middle Yukon River and tributaries CU component has increased nearly two fold since the early years of the sampling program to a recent 10-year average of 58%. This increase has appeared to come at the expense of Chinook assigned to the North Yukon River and tributaries, Pelly, White River and tributaries, Stewart, and Yukon River-Teslin headwaters CUs, which have decreased 30-60%. The Nordenskiold CU has remained relatively consistent, producing a small component of the SMU, approximately 1%, while the Upper Yukon River CU has increased slightly over time to nearly 5%.

Yukon River Chinook salmon have a stream-type life history where fry remain in streams, rivers or lakes prior to out-migrating to the Bering Sea as 1- or 2-year-old smolts [@bradford2009freshwater], though occasionally age-0 smolts have been observed [@bradford2008]. During the first summer, fry will migrate into non-natal streams, sometimes up to 75 km upstream or hundreds of kilometers downstream in search of optimal foraging and rearing habitats [@bradford2008; @daum2011]. Smolt out-migration is believed to be direct and occurs between April and June but understanding of smolt behaviour and out-migration timing is limited due to logistical constraints during the sampling period as smolts can migrate under ice [@bradford2008; @wilson2025].

Once smolts reach the Yukon River estuary, they exit the area by July or August [@howard2017; @myers2010]. Juveniles move offshore into the northeastern Bering Sea are are found in depths greater than 30 m by September-October. They overwinter in the southeastern Bering Sea at the edge of the shelf break [@myers2010; @murphy2023]. Juvenile and immature Chinook salmon spend summers in the central Bering Sea and winters in the southeastern Bering Sea [@myers2010]. After spending 2-6 years at sea, mature adults return to the shallow northeastern Bering Sea in the early summer [@myers2010; @wilson2025]. 

Adult Canadian Yukon River Chinook salmon begin their upstream freshwater migration in May to June each year [@brown_catalog_2017; @wilson2025]. Spawning populations located further upstream tend to return later on average, when compared with populations lower in the Canadian portion of the drainage [@connors2022]. Performing one of the longest freshwater migrations known for Pacific salmon, they traverse approximately 2,000 km in 30 days to reach the U.S. / Canada border in late June – August [@eiler2015migratory; @wilson2025]. From here, the distance to spawning habitat varies by population, ranging from less than 100 km to over 1,000 km [@brown_catalog_2017], and spawning is completed by approximately mid-September [@JTC2025Report; @wilson2025]. Adaptation to this long migration has resulted in Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook salmon being, on average, older and larger, with a higher fat content when compared to other populations in the basin [@eiler2015migratory].
