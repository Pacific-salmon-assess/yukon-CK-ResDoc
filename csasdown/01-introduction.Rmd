# INTRODUCTION {#sec:introduction}


## BACKGROUND

Yukon River Chinook salmon undergo one of the longest freshwater migrations of any Pacific salmon and spawn in hundreds of locations within the Canadian portion of the Yukon River basin (Brown et al. 2017). These spawning locations populations in Canada make up two Stock Management Units (SMU; DFO 2024a), the Yukon Chinook Salmon River SMU and Porcupine Chinook Salmon SMU, and together are comprised of twelve Conservation Units (CUs; Holtby and Ciruna 2007; Holtby 2011). Nine CUs are from watersheds draining into the mainstem of the Yukon River and three from the Porcupine River that flows into the Yukon River in Alaska. The SMUs are  subject to assessment and fishery management provisions in the Yukon River Agreement (Chapter 8 of the Pacific Salmon Treaty) as well as domestic fishery management measures (DFO 2024b2024 IFMP). The term “stock” throughout this document refers to the major fish stock consisting of both the Yukon River SMU and the Porcupine SMUs. 
Aggregate returns of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook have declined in recent decades culminating in five of the lowest returns on record in 2021-2024 (JTC 20254). These declines have placed immense hardship on subsistence users and First Nations who depend on Yukon Chinook for food, social and cultural uses, and prompted a seven year moratorium on directed harvest in Alaska and Canada beginning in 2024 (ADFG & DFO 2024). These declines have occurred coincident with declines in average female reproductive potential (due to declines in size and age; Ohlberger et al. 2020) and changing freshwater and marine conditions experienced throughout the Chinook life cycle (Feddern et al. 2024, Murdoch et al. 2024, Howard and von Biela 2023). 

The Fisheries Management sector of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has requested science advice on stock status, and the expected impacts of harvest and rebuilding actions, on Canadian-origin Yukon River Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). It is expected both this SMUs (Yukon and Porcupine) Stock Management Unit (SMU) will be prescribed in regulation as a major fish stock under Section 6.3 of the Fisheries Act. The definition of this major fish stock under the Fisheries Act includes “the part of the Yukon River situated in Canada, the part of the Porcupine River situated in Canada, and all bodies of fresh water situated in Canada that flow directly or indirectly into the Yukon River or the Porcupine River”.

The Yukon River is one of the largest and most isolated river systems in North America, draining over 850,000 square kilometers and flowing from its headwaters in northern British Columbia through the Yukon Territory and Alaska before emptying into the Bering Sea. The Yukon River is also historically one of the largest salmon producing river basins in the world and Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) spawn throughout it. Within the Canadian portion of the basin, Chinook salmon spawn in hundreds of streams [@brown_catalog_2017] which, under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy [@WSP2005], are considered to make up nine genetically and ecologically unique groups of salmon or Conservation Units [@holtbyConservationUnitsPacific2007]. These Chinook salmon have a stream-type life history in which juveniles emerge from spawning beds in the spring, remain in freshwater for a year or two [@bradford2009freshwater], migrate from freshwater to the Bering Sea in the spring and summer as 1- or 2-year-old smolts, and remain in the ocean for 2-6 years before returning to the Yukon River as adults in May-July [@gilbert1922salmon]. Returning adults migrate upstream to spawning areas during the summer months and die after spawning in the fall. Chinook salmon from the Canadian portion of the basin enter the Yukon River earlier than those that spawn in Alaska and migrate upstream for up to 3,200km to reach their spawning grounds. As a result of their long freshwater migrations, Canadian origin Yukon Chinook salmon are generally thought to have relatively larger body size, proportionally older age-classes, and proportionally more females that are less fecund than Chinook salmon that spawn in the lower, Alaskan, portions of the river [@bromaghin2011using].  

## OBJECTIVES

The specific objectives of this research document are to:

1. describe current understanding of (a) stock structure and distribution, (b) stock, and component Conservation Unit, Wild Salmon Policy biological status and trends, and (c) anthropogenic, ecosystem, and climate factors affecting the stock;

2. describe potential rebuilding and enhancement activities that could contribute to stock rebuilding;

3. provide estimates of a Limit Reference Point and other candidate reference points (e.g., Upper Stock Reference and Removal Reference) for the Yukon SMU; 

4. provide quantitative estimates of the expected biological and fishery consequences of current and alternative harvest management measures (e.g., no fishing, interim aggregate escapement goal, rebuilding goal, exploitation rate caps based on CU overfishing risk, etc.) that could contribute to stock rebuilding;

5. propose exceptional circumstances or assessment triggers for the stock (e.g., circumstances or conditions that represent a substantial departure from those under which the advice in this assessment was developed); and 

6. identify key knowledge gaps and areas requiring future work.
